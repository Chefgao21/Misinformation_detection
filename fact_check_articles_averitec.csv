averitec_2,"Fact Check: In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government.","Claim: In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The answer and source shows that the claim is supported as the percentage to local government is the same.

Evidence:

Q: Kenya’s ex-prime minister Odinga mangles his numbers on government revenue share in Nigeria?
A: After months of an often fractious stalemate, in September 2020 Kenya’s senate hammered out a deal on how revenue would be shared  between the country’s two levels of government.

In August, at the height of the deadlock, former prime minister Odinga returned to a familiar talking point to argue for establishing a third tier of government.

Building on this in an interview with Citizen TV, Odinga, who is also an African Union envoy, said Kenya could solve the recurring battle over how to share revenue if it looked to Nigeria for lessons.

Nigeria, he said, had a local, state and federal system of government. “In terms of revenue share, 20% of the revenue goes to the local, 35% goes to the state and 45% goes to the federal governments ... and it works perfectly well,” Odinga said..

averitec_3,Fact Check: Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and health c...,"Claim: Biden has pledged to stop border wall construction and give amnesty and health care to all illegal immigrants.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: This claim should have been split into two parts, as it is quite confusing. As for the first part, the label is supported as he did say that he would not build more of the wall. As for the 2nd part, it is more tricky, as he would allow health care access to immigrants, but it does not necessarily mean they'd get access to healthcare. Therefore, the claim is supproted

Evidence:

Q: When Joe Biden participated in an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, on August 6, 2020 did he say he would tear down the border wall, if he became president?
A: No, there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration...  I’m going to make sure that we have border protection, but it’s going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to deal with it and at the ports of entry.. 

Q: If Joe Biden became president, what is his intention regarding health care for illegal immigrants?
A: According to PolitiFact Fact Checker, a task force recommended that Biden extend Affordable Care Act coverage to immigrants illegally in the country who are protected from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and allowing additional immigrants illegally in the country to also buy health insurance, unsubsidized.
So the task force recommends allowing immigrants here illegally to get access to health care, including Affordable Care Act coverage. But being able to buy health insurance doesn’t amount to getting welfare.. 

Q: What is the common reference for amnesty in modern U.S. politics?
A: The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, signed by President Ronald Reagan is the law which paved the way for immigrants who were in the country illegally to become lawful permanent residents if they met certain requirements..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Governor Evers did call for peace in a video statement on planned protests. 

Evidence:

Q: Did Governor Evers not call for peace after Jacob Blake was shot ?
A: Inn a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to  peacefully.
In a news release later that day, Evers said ""Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability.""

averitec_7,Fact Check: Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics. Her goal when founding Pl...,"Claim: Margaret Sanger was a racist who believed in eugenics. Her goal when founding Planned Parenthood was to eradicate minorities.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Evidence is conflicting with Margaret Sanger, as she was a progressive who believed in racial integration. She voted for Norman Thomas. She worked with progressive Black people—W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, who, along with Mary McCleod Bethune and Adam Clayton Powell Sr., served on the board of the Negro Project, a network of birth control and maternal health clinics Sanger established in Harlem and the South, etc. However, it does seem that Sanger believed in eugenics and thought people, especially poor people, often had too many kids to care for properly and that too many of those kids were born physically disabled (or, in the language of the day, ""feeble-minded""). She did not oppose forced sterilization.

Evidence:

Q: What is eugenics?
A: Eugenics is the practice or advocacy of improving the human species by selectively mating people with specific desirable hereditary traits. It aims to reduce human suffering by “breeding out” disease, disabilities and so-called undesirable characteristics from the human population. 

Q: What were Sangers views on eugenics?
A: I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world -- that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically. Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they're born. That to me is the greatest sin -- that people can -- can commit. 

Q: Was Sanger a racist?
A: As her biographer Ellen Chesler told me, she was a progressive who believed in racial integration. She voted for Norman Thomas. She worked with progressive Black people—W.E.B. Du Bois, for example, who along with Mary McCleod Bethune and Adam Clayton Powell Sr. served on the board of the Negro Project, a network of birth control and maternal health clinics Sanger established in Harlem and the South. In 1966, Martin Luther King accepted Planned Parenthood’s first Margaret Sanger Award, and in his statement offered a vigorous endorsement of voluntary birth control..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: One study shows anxiety dropping amongst young teenagers, but another study shows it depends on age and whether child will be receiving exam results.

Evidence:

Q: What study is this based on?
A: The study was based on a survey of around 1,000 year 9 students in the south west of England. It found that students reported lower levels of anxiety when surveyed in April and May of this year compared to October 2019. 

It also found an increase in wellbeing but “no large change in risk of depression.”. 

Q: Is this study backed up by further research?
A: There’s nothing wrong with this study in terms of its method or what it claims, but it shouldn’t necessarily be taken to represent the experience of all children across the country. 

It can’t rule out the possibility that the mental toll of the pandemic may have been different across different parts of the country, and for people of different ages. 

For example, a study out of the University of Oxford, asked parents and carers to report any changes in behavior of their children during a one-month period in lockdown. It found that while parents and carers reported that the emotional difficulties of adolescents decreased, the emotional difficulties of children aged four to ten increased. 

Also a potential contributor to feelings of anxiety among students during the pandemic has been the uncertainty over exam results, which would have primarily affected students in years 11 and 13, not year 9 (as the study itself notes)..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The claim is specific about the threshold of $400,000. There are two parts to the claim-one for people making over $400,000 and one for people making less than $400,000. The answer does not refer to the $400,000 threshold and does not specifically answer the question. Also, the answer refuses to commit anyway saying 'these numbers may change'. Further questions are required.

Evidence:

Q: Did Joe Biden refuse to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 ?
A: There is broad agreement among the five tax models that Biden’s tax increase would fall almost entirely on the very wealthy. For technical reasons, the corporate tax increase is deemed to filter through to almost all income groups, giving the Republicans an opening to misleadingly claim that Biden is raising taxes on most Americans. Those numbers may change in Biden’s favor as updated analyses are completed of all of Biden’s tax proposals.We will leave this unrated. We are not in the habit of giving check marks for campaign promises..

Interestingly, of the children presenting with symptoms, only around 28 per cent of children tested positive,  and of these, more than 60 per cent were over the age of 11, 26 per cent were obese (with less than 10 per cent in the non SARS-CoV-2 group), and exposure to the virus was by either mum or dad (77 per cent), supporting a larger role for adults in the transmission of this virus..

Massachusetts General Hospital.

A: The Proclamation placed entry restrictions
on the nationals of eight foreign states whose systems for managing
and sharing information about their nationals the President deemed
inadequate. Foreign states were selected for inclusion based on a review undertaken pursuant to one of the President’s earlier Executive
Orders. As part of that review, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the State Department and intelligence
agencies, developed an information and risk assessment “baseline.”
DHS then collected and evaluated data for all foreign governments,
identifying those having deficient information-sharing practices and
presenting national security concerns, as well as other countries “at
risk” of failing to meet the baseline..

Jeon Kwang-hun attending the anti-government demonstration on August 15th.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems from  rhe 2nd QA that no measures were taken. Therefore the claim  is refuted 

Evidence:

Q: What happened which caused the COVID-19 outbreak?
A: This new burst of patients has been linked to conservative pastor Rev. Jeon Kwang-hun’s Sarang Jeil Church (SJC) after one member was tested positive for the coronavirus on Aug. 12. Three days later the SJC members took part in a mass anti-government demonstration – despite being told by health officials to self-isolate.

More than 30,000 people participated in the protests on Aug. 15, Korea’s Independence Day, to demand that President Moon Jae-In step down. At the rally, the Rev. Jeon expressed doubt regarding the government’s response to the virus in religious communities and suggested there was a government plot to purposefully spread the virus.. 

Q: Did the church take preventative measures to limit the spread of COVID-19?
A: According to media reports, the SJC has not followed government-issued outlines for sermons. The list of churchgoers submitted by the church for case-tracking purposes was found to be faulty, and Rev. Jeon was caught on a video speaking and walking around without a mask.

The city of Seoul filed a lawsuit against the church for violation of disease prevention laws and obstructing quarantine procedures.

Jeon, whose church is not officially recognized, tested positive for the coronavirus two days after the protests. Against regulations, he had taken off his mask on his way to the hospital..

A: The top White House official responsible for leading the U.S. response in the event of a deadly pandemic has left the administration, and the global health security team he oversaw has been disbanded under a reorganization by national security adviser John Bolton.

The abrupt departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council means no senior administration official is now focused solely on global health security. Ziemer’s departure, along with the breakup of his team, comes at a time when many experts say the country is already underprepared for the increasing risks of a pandemic or bioterrorism attack..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: QA pair confirms he suggested delaying the election in a tweet dated July 30th but in another QA pair he is quoted as saying he never even thought of that and why would he want to delay the election.

It is mentioned in QA pairs he ""joked"" about staying in office longer than the maximum 2 terms but QA pairs do not make reference to him saying he wont leave if he loses the election.




Evidence:

Q: Did Trump want to delay the election in 2020?
A: ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"" he tweeted July 30.. 

Q: Did Trump threaten to not leave office?
A: Trump’s certainty that he simply cannot lose could have a real impact on this year’s election. Since assuming office in January 2017, Trump has made at least 27 references to staying in office beyond the constitutional limit of two terms. He often follows up with a remark indicating he is “joking,” “kidding,” or saying it to drive the “fake” news media “crazy.” Even if Trump thinks that he’s only “joking,” the comments fit a broader pattern that raises the prospect that Trump may not leave office quietly in the event he’s on the losing end of a very close election. And unfortunately this possibility is only one of a number of potential election meltdowns we may face in November.. 

Q: Who has the power to decide when elections hold
A: Constitution empowers Congress to set the date by which states must choose their presidential electors, according to a March report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service..

Of course, you still need to rely on the mail to get the debit card. Social Security notices also come through the mail, unless a person opts out. But relatively few people still get checks..

Justification: It seems from the 3rd QA that the group was indeed disbanded therefore the claim is supported 

Evidence:

Q: Did Vice President Biden and President Obama assemble a pandemic playbook to make sure that America was prepared and protected?
A: Yes. Through the Obama administration, the NSC devised the guide — officially called the Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents, but known colloquially as ""the pandemic playbook"" — across 2016. The project was driven by career civil servants as well as political appointees, aware that global leaders had initially fumbled their response to the 2014–2015 spread of Ebola and wanting to be sure that the next response to an epidemic was better handled.

Q: Did President Donald Trump utilize the pandemic playbook?
A: No. The Trump administration was briefed on the playbook’s existence in 2017, said four former officials, but two cautioned that it never went through a full, National Security Council-led interagency process to be approved as Trump administration strategy.

Q: Did President Donald Trump disband the pandemic response team that was given to him?

Ultimately, it's more critical to drink enough water as the temperature makes minimal difference.

A: According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS-CoV-2 is still mainly transmitted through respiratory secretions or droplets that can reach the mouth, nose and eyes of someone who comes in close contact with a COVID-19-infected person.. 

Q: Can COVID-19 be transmitted through airborne transmission?
A: Yes. WHO and the U.S. CDC also acknowledged increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne transmission, but current evidence shows that it only occurs in indoor spaces with poor ventilation. WHO said further studies are needed to establish if airborne transmission may occur in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures.

SARS-CoV-2 can become airborne when tiny droplets called droplet nuclei or aerosols containing it get suspended in the air, according to a global team of public health experts convened by international non-profit media group Meedan. Droplet nuclei are microscopic and much smaller in size than respiratory droplets (almost five to 10 micrometers), according to WHO.

averitec_136,Fact Check: Donald Trump's payroll tax deferral could leave American workers liable for thou...,"Claim: Donald Trump's payroll tax deferral could leave American workers liable for thousands of dollars during tax season and could potentially leave programs like Social Security and Medicare weakened.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The tax cut is what helps fund social security and the payroll tax deferral lets the people keep the money instead of sending it to the government to help fund the social security scheme 

Evidence:

Q: What was Trumps tax deferral?
A: Trump issued a memo that told employers they didn’t need to send Washington the 6.2% out of each employee’s paycheck that helps fund Social Security. So, someone making $1,000 a week — the national median pay — could see an extra $62 every week. The tax break applies to people making up to $2,000 a week and would be in place for four months, September through December.. 

Q: Why would the tax deferral potentially cost people money during the tax season?
A: The more a person makes, up to the maximum, the more money they would keep. At the high end, a person could see a tax cut of $1,984 over those 16 weeks.

Trump had the power to defer collecting the tax, but as written, his order provided only temporary relief. At some point, the missed payments would need to be made up or count as foregone revenues to the Social Security trust fund. The memo said the administration will look for a way to let people keep the money, but that decision rests with Congress, not the president..

averitec_139,Fact Check: T cells may play a role in the body’s immune response against the virus SARS-CoV...,"Claim: T cells may play a role in the body’s immune response against the virus SARS-CoV-2

Verdict: Supported

Justification: This claim is supported. According to the QA pairs, T cells have the ability to aid memory cells when an pathogen enters the body that needs to be destroyed. The more times that pathogen tries to affect the immune system, the memory cells (aided by T cells) respond faster and stronger to kill off the infection. Therefore, T cells do play a role in the body's immune system against COVID-19 as if a person were to catch COVID-19 twice, the T cells help weaken the infection. This claim is supported. 

Evidence:

Q: What are T cells role in clearing viral infections?
A: T cells recognize and kill infected cells. The cells of the adaptive immune system are lymphocytes – B cells and T cells. A key feature of the adaptive immune system is memory. Repeat infections by the same virus are met immediately with a strong and specific response that usually effectively stops the infection with less reliance on the innate system. When we say we are immune to infection with a virus, we are talking about immune memory. Vaccines protect us against infection because of immune memory. The first adaptive response against a virus – called the primary response – often takes days to mature. In contrast, a memory response develops within hours of infection. Memory is maintained by a subset of B and T lymphocytes called memory cells which survive for years in the body. Memory cells remain ready to respond rapidly and efficiently to a subsequent encounter with a pathogen. This so-called secondary response is often stronger than the primary response to infection. Consequently, childhood infections protect adults, and immunity conferred by vaccination can last for years.. 

Q: What does the National Geographic article say that specifically relates to the role of T cells for the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
A: The article references findings by Aleman, a researcher and physician at the Karolinska University in sweden.
Killer T cells, which tell virus-infected human cells to destroy themselves to keep the virus from spreading - In a subset of those who tested positive for COVID-19, Aleman found T cells but no antibodies. Aleman says, one thing is becoming clear: antibodies might not be telling the whole story when it comes to COVID-19 immunity. “We shouldn’t just look blindly at antibody tests."" The article also states, Aleman and other virologists and immunologists when turning their attention to COVID-19, they began to study how immunity developed in people who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as their close contacts, some of whom were presumably exposed to the virus, even if they didn’t get sick. As expected, hospitalized individuals developed strong antibody and T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. But two-thirds of the close contacts who were asymptomatic showed a subsequent T cell response, even though tests didn’t detect any antibodies - Study results, released June 29 without peer review via the medical pre-print service medRxiv, didn’t reveal whether these individuals never developed antibodies or whether they rapidly declined to undetectable levels. Regardless, the report immediately raised concerns about a vaccine, since stimulating antibody production is a key strategy by which immunizations protect against disease.

The article also cites recently reported work by immunologist Antonio Bertoletti from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore - Patients infected with the original SARS virus still possessed memory T cells that responded to the virus’ proteins 17 years later. These same memory T cells also reacted to SARS-CoV-2. It’s something Bertoletti says bodes well for COVID-19.. 

Q: What reaction did the claim recieve from the scientific community?
A: One study by immunologist Antonio Bertoletti as reference in the National Geographic article - 'SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls' is cited on 'Nature' 1034 times..

averitec_144,Fact Check: 82% of the public are wearing face masks on Translink buses and trains.,"Claim: 82% of the public are wearing face masks on Translink buses and trains.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The fourth Q&A shows that around 80% are wearing masks so the claim is supported.

Evidence:

Q: Are face masks mandatory on buses and trains in the UK ?
A: Masks will be made mandatory for anyone in England wanting to use public transport, including the Tube, buses and trains from 15 June onwards.

Travellers will be refused access to public transport if they do not comply with these rules, which have been put in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus, as more people head back to work.

The government has said face coverings should be worn on trains, underground trains, buses, ferries and planes. But people won’t have to wear them inside railway stations or at bus terminals. UK transport secretary Grant Shapps said tonight: “I can announce that as of Monday 15 June, face coverings will become mandatory on public transport.

“The evidence suggests that wearing a face mask offers some, limited protection. It’s a condition of travel. You cannot travel if you are not wearing a face covering.”

However, there will be exemptions for anyone with breathing difficulties and young children.. 

Q: Are there people exempted from the use of face masks face coverings on buses?
A: You do not need to wear a face covering if you have a legitimate reason not to or are exempt on other grounds - these include the following:

    not being able to put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability
    if you have a medical condition that prevents you from wearing a mask such as respiratory illness
    if putting on, wearing or removing a face covering will cause you severe distress
    if you are travelling with or providing assistance to someone who relies on lip reading to communicate
    to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury, to yourself or others
    to avoid injury, or to escape a risk of harm, and you do not have a face covering with you
    to eat or drink, but only if you need to and replace your face covering as soon as possible
    to take medication
    if a police officer or other official requests you remove your face covering
    a child who is under the age of 11
    any employee of the operator, or anyone contracted to provide a service on behalf of the operator who is performing their duty - although as mentioned above, reasonable alternative measures should be in place unless not possible to do so.
    a member of the emergency services who are performing their duties

Please remember that there may be people on the list above who are exempt from wearing a face covering. Not all reasons are visible so please be mindful of others who may not be wearing a mask for a legitimate reason. 

Operators such as ourselves have been given discretion on how they enforce the new requirement to wear a face covering with the preferred method being “engage, explain, encourage”. Our drivers are not police officers and so are not there to enforce the law, but by following the Government guidelines, we are trying to engage people to explain the new law and then encourage them to wear face coverings in future.. 

Q: Which area does the claim refer to?

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Seems that the actual infection cases are increasing not just the testing,from the 2nd QA. Therefore the claim is refuted 

Evidence:

Q: When did testing increase in the US?
A: In May 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a COVID-19 RAT, the Sofia 2 test manufactured by Quidel and by mid may testing was increasing. 

Rockefeller foundation, called for the nation to get to three million Covid-19 tests a week by July and to 30 million by October.. 

Q: How much did positive covid tests increase beween May to July?
A: May had brought signs of hope that the U.S. had gotten its Covid-19 outbreak under control, with about 20,000 new cases reported per day after April highs closer to 30,000. But by late June, the daily count climbed to about 40,000, and now it’s at about 70,000. 

Q: Can this increase be explained solely by the increase in testing?
A: No. Epidemiologists and infectious disease experts have disputed the White House claims for weeks, citing rising hospitalization numbers and deaths. It’s hard to argue that extremely sick people, let alone dead people, had been obscured by low levels of testing but suddenly revealed by higher levels.

Without a doubt, many cases of Covid-19 in March, April, and May weren’t picked up. In late June, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told reporters that as many as 90% of cases had been missed; that is, although there were 2.3 million confirmed cases in the U.S. then, some 20 million people had probably been infected. But that reasoning applies today, too: Despite months of government claims to the contrary, not everyone who wants, or should have, a test is getting one. Using data from Covid Tracking, STAT looked at the number of people tested and the number who tested positive for the disease (cases) in every state and Washington, D.C. We did that for three dates: in mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July. (Due to reporting anomalies, the dates selected sometimes differed by a day or two between states.)

For each date, we calculated the number of cases found per 1,000 tests — a measure of the disease’s prevalence. For example, in Florida on May 13, that rate was 32. On June 13 it was 75. On July 13 it was 193. On May 13, Florida tested 15,159 people; on July 13, it tested 65,567. So indeed, the number of tests has increased.

averitec_156,Fact Check: You can test too much for Covid-19.,"Claim: You can test too much for Covid-19.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The Q&As sources show positives and negatives for frequent testing for COVID-19.  Therefore the claim label selected is conflicting evidence.

Evidence:

Q: Can you overtest for COVID-19?
A: Frequent testing of the entire population would help identify so-called hidden hidden carriers — individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, but who have no symptoms of it. They seem to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19. Identifying these silent spreaders could help public health workers be more effective at contract tracing by identifying others who have been exposed and may require quarantine.. 

Q: What are the downsides of overtesting for COVID-19?
A: There are also the harms of Covid-19 testing to consider.

Perhaps the biggest challenge is false negatives — tests signaling no infection in those who are indeed infected. Covid-19 testing is typically performed on samples from behind the nose or in the back of the mouth, and will be positive only if the sample happens to contain the virus. In some people, the virus may be present in high quantities only deep in the lungs. False negatives occur surprisingly often — perhaps as often as one-third of the time — which could lead to a false sense of security among those with such results.

Testing those without symptoms can also lead to false alarms. PCR testing for the virus, which is the best way to identify an active infection, can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 — or remnants of it — for weeks, even when the infection is unlikely to be transmitted to others. Testing the entire population would undoubtedly identify a large number of such individuals, unnecessarily sidelining them from work and society.. 

Q: When should you get tested for COVID-19?
A: You should always get tested when you have symptoms for COVID-19.

You should also get tested when you’ve had close contact with someone who has Covid. Test 3 to 5 days after your exposure. Testing earlier to find out if you’re positive is optional.

Also get tested when asked by your school, workplace, doctor, or the Department Public of Health.

Testing is a good idea before and after activities that put you or others at higher risk for Covid, like:

Large gatherings
Crowded indoor settings
Testing is also a good idea when you work somewhere with a higher risk of transmission, like:

Homeless shelters
Jails
Places where you have close contact with the public.

averitec_157,Fact Check: Trump did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception ...,"Claim: Trump did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Although Trump did do some things for the black community, the last questions shows experts disagree. 

Evidence:

Q: What has Trump done for the black community?
A: He earned a Promise Kept for his pledge to ensure funding for historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. 

Trump signed the bipartisan FUTURE Act in 2019 to ensure that the original science, technology, engineering and math funding for HBCUs from President George W. Bush's 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act would continue to be awarded.. 

Q: Where do historians rank Trump in relation to his achievements for the black community?
A: While Trump has made this assertion before, historians disagree. Right behind Lincoln, who prosecuted the Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, would be President Lyndon B. Johnson.

Johnson, a skilled legislator from his years in the Senate, deliberately crafted his agenda and pushed it through Congress with personal persuasion, to a far greater degree than Trump, historians say.

""His accomplishments on behalf of African Americans — the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act — were historic,"" said University of Texas historian H.W. Brands.

Jeffrey A. Engel, director of Southern Methodist University’s Center for Presidential History, sees Johnson and President Harry Truman, who moved to desegregate the military, as being among recent presidents who were ahead of their times.

Even a president like Richard Nixon, who was captured on tape making racist remarks, had a fairly robust legacy on civil rights, advancing the desegregation of schools and affirmative action in employment, said John J. Pitney, Jr., a Claremont McKenna College political scientist..

Evidence:

Q: Did the unemployment rate decrease during Trump's administration for Black Americans and their median household income increase
A: High employment under Trump led to minorities experiencing the largest income gains. Real median income grew by 7.9% for Blacks in 2019. That outpaced 2018’s income growth of 2.6% and 2017’s income decline of -2.4%. Notably, Black median income growth last year surpassed income growth rates under the Obama administration. There’s still more work to do though. Although Black median income hit a new high, Blacks earned the lowest income level of all groups (just over $45,000 a year).

Justification: The post mortem has been conducted but does not make a definite ruling on cause of death.

Justification: The evidence suggests that Covid-19 is much more infectious and much more deadly than H1N1, therefore we need to be more aware and cautious about our attitudes to fighting the virus 

Evidence:

Q: What is the H1N1 virus?
A: H1N1 is a new influenza virus causing illness in people.   This new virus was first detected in people in the U.S. in April 2009 and was initially call “swine flu.”   In some respects the H1N1 virus is just like any other influenza virus. It causes a predominantly respiratory illness.. 

Q: Is COVID-19 deadlier than the H1N1 virus?
A: We know that COVID-19 spreads fast, and we know that it is deadly – 10 times deadlier than the 2009 flu pandemic.

We know that the virus can spread more easily in crowded environments like nursing homes. 

We know that early case-finding, testing, isolating caring for every case and tracing every contact is essential for stopping transmission.

We know that in some countries, cases are doubling every 3 to 4 days.. 

Q: Why is it important to treat COVID-19 seriously?
A: The WHO is “deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction,” and he called on countries to take action now to contain the virus. “We should double down,” he said. “We should be more aggressive.”.

Evidence:

Q: What proportion of unemployed Americans receive benefits that exceed their lost earnings?
A: 68%. 

Q: What are unemployed individuals earning that means they are earning more out of work than they would be in work?
A: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES) Act substantially expanded Unemploy-
ment Insurance (UI) in order to help workers losing jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. One provision
of the Act creates an additional $600 weekly benefit known as the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Com-
pensation (FPUC). The size of the payment—$600—was designed to replace 100 percent of the mean U.S.
wage when combined with mean state UI benefits.. 

Q: What is the ratio between the unemployment benefits to mean pre-tax wages?
A: As designed, the ratio of mean unemployment benefits to mean pre-tax wages under CARES is roughly
100%. However, this masks substantial heterogeneity. We find that 76% of unemployed workers have a
statutory replacement rate above 100%..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Police in South Africa kill 2.8 times more than police in USA but the mapping police  violence project doesn't record instances of “people who were killed by a civilian driver or crashed without being hit directly by police during a police pursuit”. South Africa, on the other hand, records all deaths due to collisions “while being pursued by police”.

Based on the limitations of the available data and the number of deaths that may go unreported in both countries so , it is hard to say these are accurate.

Evidence:

Q: How many people were killed by US police officers in 2018?
A: Its researchers estimated that 1,140 people were killed by US police in 2018 – or 3.5 people per million. South Africa’s rate was 2.8 times larger.. 

Q: How many people were killed by South African police officers in 2018?
A: Clarke said he used Ipid’s 2017/18 figures on the number of people who died as a result of police action (558) and South Africa’s 2018 population estimate. Based on this, there were about 9.7 reported deaths as a result of police action for each million people in South Africa.. 

Q: Are these statistics likely accurate?
A: The Mapping Police Violence project does not record instances of “people who were killed by a civilian driver or crashed without being hit directly by police during a police pursuit”. South Africa, on the other hand, records all deaths due to collisions “while being pursued by police”.

averitec_200,Fact Check: Ghislaine Maxwell tested positive for Covid-19 in jail.,"Claim: Ghislaine Maxwell tested positive for Covid-19 in jail.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that the claim was featured on a satirical website and is not true so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?
A: Ghislaine Maxwell was, according to her accusers, Jeffrey Epstein’s protector and procurer, his girlfriend and his madam. She was, by all accounts, a soul mate and a mirror image. He grew up in Brooklyn with no money to speak of and never finished college. She is Paris-born, Oxford-educated, a jet-setter who partied with princes and billionaires.

Together, Epstein and Maxwell allegedly built what prosecutors, police and a growing number of women described as a sex-trafficking operation that crisscrossed the nation to provide Epstein with three young girls a day.. 

Q: Where did the article stating that Ghislaine Maxwell has tested positive for Covid-19 in jail occur?
A: The Brown Valley Observer. 

Q: Is the Brown Valley Observer a satirical news source?
A: Yes. This is an entertainment website written to satirize news events, politics, and popular faces and ideas, and to provide commentary on social attitudes and trends.
While familiar names of celebrities and other media figures as well as familiar agencies and organizations are used, all news stories contained within are fictional in nature. Most of the words and actions attributed to these figures are created entirely by the author, who has tiny, feminine hands, and who was once friend-zoned by his own sister.
The purpose of this site is to entertain. Failing that, we’ll settle for “bother” or “annoy”. We’re not a particularly proud publication.
Please do not attempt anything described in any of these articles, except under strict hip-hop supervision.
Similarities between events published here and any actual events involving pretty much anyone would really be a shame.

Q: Is there anything suspicious about the screenshot?
A: Yes. The screenshot looks to be from a Brazilian site which only publishes in Portuguese but the screenshot is in English

Q: What did Taylor Swift say regarding monuments and was she referring to the Statue of Liberty?
A: ""As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such."" Taylor Swift's original quote referred to Confederate monuments in Tennessee and in no way referenced the Statue of Liberty..

averitec_202,Fact Check: COVID Outbreak Discovered in Oregon Minks,"Claim: COVID Outbreak Discovered in Oregon Minks

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Minks tested positive for covid-19 

Evidence:

Q: Can Mink contract Covid_19?
A: Minks were infected following exposure from infected humans. Minks can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2, passing the virus between them, and pose a risk for virus spill-over from mink to humans. People can then transmit this virus within the human population. Additionally, spill-back (human to mink transmission) can occur. It remains a concern when any animal virus spills in to the human population, or when an animal population could contribute to amplifying and spreading a virus affecting humans. As viruses move between human and animal populations, genetic modifications in the virus can occur. These changes can be identified through whole genome sequencing, and when found, experiments can study the possible implications of these changes on the disease in humans.. 

Q: Are minks susceptible to covid_19 ?
A: ink are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Pair this fact with the crowded, filthy conditions on fur farms, and a disastrous and deadly public health situation is inevitable.. 

Q: Was COVID Outbreak Discovered in Oregon Minks?A
A: Mink on fur farms in Michigan, Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin have tested positive for COVID-19. Research now shows that infected mink may contract the virus from humans and can transmit SARS-CoV-2 back to humans. This cycle has led to the development of mutated strains of the virus. Wild mink have also tested positive for COVID-19 in Utah..

Evidence:

Q: Has the US had any intelligence that Russia is offering bounties for the killing of US troops in Afghanistan?
A: Yes. Leading Republican lawmakers on Monday confirmed that U.S. intelligence agencies have developed information about a Russian military operation targeting U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Supported at 92.5% in QA Pair.

Evidence:

Q: Was there high level of child lead poisoning in Zamfara State Nigeria 2017 ?
A: The World Health Organization (WHO), which has been assisting the Government in managing the situation, called for Nigerian authorities to increase their commitment to combat lead poisoning by strengthening its capacity to diagnose, treat and manage it, as well as ensuring that all areas have been de-contaminated.

In a news release, WHO warned that lead poisoning cannot be successfully eliminated without significant changes to mining practices, including the relocation of ore processing activities and storage of ore materials away from villages.

Other necessary measures recommended by WHO include the adoption of processing methods that produce less dust, and hygiene measures such as removing contaminated clothes and washing before returning home.

Lead poisoning damages the nervous system and causes brain and blood disorders. Treatment is time-consuming and expensive as it involves undergoing long-term therapy with chelating agents, which remove heavy metals from the body.

Treatment also involves persuading people to adopt new practices and behaviours, something which requires an ongoing effort from authorities to continuously raise awareness and make sure the population follows preventive measures.

According to WHO, children in seven villages in Zamfara state require chelation therapy. This is in addition to the residents of seven other villages who have already received treatment. In these villages the combined effects of removing children from lead exposure and providing chelation therapy caused the child mortality rate to drop from 43 per cent to 1 per cent in one year.

Since the problem was discovered last year, $1.9 million has been provided by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to WHO and the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which have been used to provide treatment, train doctors, provide quick diagnoses, and raise awareness about the hazards of lead.. 

Q: Was there a 92% prevalence of blood lead poisoning in Zamfara  due to gold mining?
A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: What was the reason behind  high levels of child lead poisoning in Zamfara State Nigeria?
A: Gold rush triggers deadly lead poisoning in Nigeria.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Answers states no evidence and not known to cause DNA damage.

Evidence:

Q: Do the radio frequency waves from cell towers cause health problems?
A: At this time, there’s no strong evidence that exposure to RF waves from cell phone towers causes any noticeable health effects.. 

Q: What type of radiation do RF waves produce?
A: Like FM radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and heat, they are forms of non-ionizing radiation.. 

Q: Does non-ionizing radiation damage DNA?
A: They do not directly damage the DNA inside cells, which is how stronger (ionizing) types of radiation such as x-rays, gamma rays, and ultraviolet (UV) rays are thought to be able to cause cancer..

averitec_229,Fact Check: Those most susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology are fetuses in utero ...,"Claim: Those most susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology are fetuses in utero and children.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A 2 states that what is claimed 5G  exposure of foetuses and children is not well studied. However Q&A 3 states the 5g tech uses non-ionising type radiation which is shown to not be dangerous to dna, Also Q&A 4 shows that the WHO says it is safe for children

Evidence:

Q: Are children susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology?
A: Children have smaller heads than adults.  Cell phones and wireless radiation can go deeper into their brains because children have a shorter distance from their skull to their brain center.. 

Q: Are fetuses in utero susceptible to the radiation from 5G technology?
A: Cell-phone use has rapidly increased during the last several decades (1). Cell phones generate radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF), resulting in local exposure of the human body to RF-EMF. Concerns have been raised regarding the potential effects of RF-EMF exposure on human health. Short-term exposure in adults is regarded as safe; however, potential health effects of long-term exposure and exposure of fetuses and children are not well studied (2, 3).

The interpretation of results from epidemiologic studies evaluating health effects of RF-EMF exposure from cell-phone use is challenging. Because of the technical evolution of mobile communication systems, similar levels of cell-phone use do not necessarily induce similar levels of RF-EMF exposure. Users’ exposure to RF-EMF from third-generation (3G) devices is much lower than that from second-generation (2G) devices (4). More recent technologies (4G/5G) also differ from 3G devices, though less, in terms of users’ exposure.. 

Q: Does the radiation from 5G towers damage dna?
A: Like FM radio waves, microwaves, visible light, and heat, they are forms of non-ionizing radiation. This means they do not directly damage the DNA inside cells, which is how stronger (ionizing).

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is no scientific research to support this claim so it is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Does 5G radiation have any effect on men's health
A: According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and expert studies, there’s nothing to suggest 5G mmWave is a significant health risk, but it’s clear there is more research to be done on the subject.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Only about 19 people have been confirmed dead as a result of the protests and about 700 police officers nationwide 

Evidence:

Q: Have there been news reports about how many people have been injured?
A: WASHINGTON — More than 700 law enforcement officers have been injured on the job during nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd — with nearly 300 of those among New York’s Finest, according to the Department of Justice and the NYPD.. 

Q: Is there any estimates of how much it has cost in damages?
A: Not an exact amount but estimates are made.

Prior to 2020, the costliest civil disorder event in U.S. was the 1992 Los Angeles riots, according to PCS, the insurance industry's primary source for compiling and reporting insured losses resulting from catastrophes, from hurricanes to wildfires.

That five-day event caused about $1.4 billion in 2020 dollars, according to PCS. Two days of riots following the funeral of Freddie Gray caused $26 million in losses in Baltimore alone.

Protests for police reform, racial injustice continue to spread across the USVideo
But losses stemming from the Floyd protests are likely to far exceed that. In Minneapolis, where some 400 businesses were damaged, owners and insurance experts estimate costs of the damage to exceed $500 million, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.. 

Q: How many people have died?
A: Though curfews are lifting and protests remain predominantly peaceful, the death toll from two weeks of demonstrations over the death of George Floyd continues to creep upward, with at least 19 people—a majority of whom are black—now dead..

averitec_235,Fact Check: Clint Eastwood endorsed Donald Trump.,"Claim: Clint Eastwood endorsed Donald Trump.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the answer it seems quite clear that Clint Eastwood might have supported Donald Trump before, but will now not continue doing so. Therefore the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: Did Clint Eastwood express support for Donald Trump ?
A: Longtime Republican Clint Eastwood is pulling support from Donald Trump in the 2020 election. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the actor-director signaled that he thinks a different candidate would be the better choice.

“The best thing we could do is just get Mike Bloomberg in there,” he said.

After endorsing Mitt Romney and famously delivering a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention to an empty chair that represented Barack Obama, Eastwood never officially backed Trump. In a 2016 interview, he expressed displeasure with Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying there’s “much funny business on both sides of the aisle.”

He praised Trump at the time because he was “onto something” and “secretly everybody’s getting tired of political correctness, kissing up.”

“We’re really in a p—y generation. Everybody’s walking on eggshells. We see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff. When I grew up, those things weren’t called racist,” he said.

Now, he’s changed his tune a bit on Trump.

While he approves of “certain things” the president has done, he wishes that he would act “in a more genteel way, without tweeting and calling people names. I would personally like for him to not bring himself to that level,” he said.

Eastwood also touched on the controversy surrounding Olivia Wilde’s character, Kathy Scruggs, in his 2019 film “Richard Jewell.” He showed Scruggs, the real-life reporter who alleged Jewell planted a bomb at the 1996 Olympics, sleeping with an FBI source to get information. Lawyers for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the newspaper at which Scruggs worked, called the portrayal “entirely false and malicious, and…extremely defamatory and damaging.” The film was Clintwood’s worst opening in 40 years.

The director defended his right to cinematic freedom and said the newspaper was trying to shroud its “guilt” over a “reckless story.”

“Well, she hung out at a little bar in town, where mostly police officers went,” he said.

Justification: - Q&A 2 shows 6.9% allocated to agriculture in 2020 (time of claim)
- Q&A 2 shows 6.7% allocated the year before which is 0.2% less than 2019  and not the +0.6% increase as claimed

Evidence:

Q: What was the percentage difference in agriculture allocation, compared to last years allocation in Kenya.
A: Counties have made remarkable achievements towards the realization of 100 per cent
food and nutrition security. To achieve this, County Governments have focused on
improving both crop and animal productivity. Some of the key interventions are:
 Empowerment of farmers through mechanization of production systems
evidenced by the purchase of 366 tractors and equipping of 26 Agriculture
mechanization stations offering lease services to rural farmers.
 Distribution of over 2 Million 50-kgs bags of subsidized fertilizer.
 Under the County subsidies arrangements, 1400 greenhouses have also been
purchased and distributed to farmers in the year under review.
 Enhanced uptake of commercialized agriculture through construction of over 140
markets that provided direct access to markets for farmers
 Vaccination of 46 Million Livestock and construction of over 500 cattle dips that
has improved disease control and surveillance.
Provision of over 1 million recorded Artificial Insemination Services to livestock
farmers and purchase of over 300 Milk coolers distributed as input subsidies to
farmer’s co-operatives. In return this has enhanced animal productivity and value
addition on raw products.
 County Governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the
Agriculture sector. This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation as per
the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo
declaration. The achievement of the 10% required or more would be realized if the
devolved monies held at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation, are
released to Counties. The Council will continue to pursue reforms in this sector to
ensure the best interest of the farmers in the Counties is achieved.
 On the overall, the performance of the agriculture sector in the year 2018/2019
significantly improved as per the Economic Survey report 2019. Compared to
2017/2018, maize production increased by 26.0 % from 35.4 million bags. 

Q: What was the percentage allocation for agriculture in 2019?
A: County Governments have allocated on average 6.7 % of their total budgets to the
Agriculture sector. This is just 3% less of the 10% recommended allocation as per
the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) Malabo
declaration.. 

Q: What was the percentage allocation for agriculture in 2020?
A: 6.9%.

averitec_276,Fact Check: Greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone laye...,"Claim: Greenhouse gases emitted into the ocean are causing more holes in the ozone layer; the ozone layer has holes in it, causing global temperatures to rise.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Greenhouse gas doesn't cause holes in the ozone layer, and holes in the ozone doesn't contribute much to rising global temperatures

Evidence:

Q: What causes holes in the ozone layer?
A: ...bromine gases from human-produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons have destroyed ozone molecules.. 

Q: Are the ozone holes causing the global temperature to rise?
A: Because the ozone layer normally blocks ultraviolet (UV) light, an ozone hole allows more UV light than usual to reach the surface. However, the additional energy added to the Earth system from the ozone hole is so small that it couldn’t be responsible for the warming trend that’s been occurring.. 

Q: What are the main causes of global warming?
A: The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.

Many of these greenhouse gases occur naturally, but human activities are increasing the concentrations of some of them in the atmosphere, in particular:

carbon dioxide (CO2)
methane
nitrous oxide
fluorinated gases
CO2 produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming. By 2020, its concentration in the atmosphere had risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750)..

Q: What was Trump administration response to Covid-19 ?
A: Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden and distinguished members of this committee. It is an honor to appear before you today to discuss the Department of Health and Human Services’ ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  We are grateful for this opportunity to address how each of our agencies and office are harnessing innovation to prevent, diagnose, and treat the novel coronavirus SARs-CoV-2.

COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. This new disease, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.  There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses.  Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19.  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated in animals and then spread to people..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The ongoing tensions between the two countries has led to the deaths of many people in recent years, showing no signs of resolution

Evidence:

Q: Has Azerbaijan government threatened to bomb the nuclear plant in Armenia?
A: Yes. ""The Armenian side must not forget that our army's state-of-the-art missile systems allow us to strike the Metsamor nuclear plant with precision, which could lead to a great catastrophe for Armenia,"" Vagif Dargahli, the Azerbaijani Defense Ministry spokesman, said on July 16, hours after hostilities had resumed following a one-day lull.

Q: Why has the Azerbaijan government threatened to bomb the nuclear plant in Armenia?
A: The July 16 warning drew outrage from Yerevan and deepened concerns that the worst violence in four years between Azerbaijan and Armenia, who are technically still in a war begun in the late 1980s, could quickly spiral out of control.

At least 16 Azerbaijanis and Armenians have died in the fighting near a northern section of their internationally recognized border that has included heavy artillery, tank, and drone attacks since it began on July 12.

Yerevan and Baku routinely threaten and accuse the other of provocations that have killed dozens of people in recent years, many of them civilians, with neither side willing to back down publicly for fear of being viewed as weak in the more than 30-year-long standoff.. 

Q: Did U.S celebrity Kim Kardashian tweet about the warning ?
A: Yes. American media personality Kim Kardashian West, whose father has Armenian heritage, posted a message about the fighting on social media.

Justification: the company was fined for violating four rules, there is no evidence that any donations accepted by John Hickenlooper was an exchange for not penalising the company. 

Evidence:

Q: Did John Hickenlooper, the former Governor of Colorado, accept donations from Anadarko Petroleum Corp, an oil and gas company involved in a 2017 fatal explosion?
A: Yes. Among the biggest donors was the former Anadarko Oil and Gas. The company donated $25,000 to the governor’s office in 2017, just days after a deadly explosion in Firestone was tied to a leaking underground pipeline owned by the company. Over the course of four years, it gave the governor’s office more than $330,000, money for which there is little accounting.

Q: Had Anadarko Petroleum Corp donated to Hickenlooper’s administration prior to the Firestone accident?
A: Yes. A Hickenlooper campaign spokesperson told us the company had already contributed nearly $219,000 to Hickenlooper’s administration prior to the Firestone accident.

Q: Is there evidence to suggest that the donated money by  Anadarko Petroleum Corp to Hickenlooper’s administration was a form of pay off?
A: No. The analysis found no evidence that the donations were connected to official action taken by Hickenlooper’s administration.

finances. We will call for conditioning federal funding for new, expanded charter schools or for

Justification: This claim is refuted. According to the QA pairs, there is quite literally nothing in Biden's mandate that means ""no windows"" to combat carbon emissions. The mandate explains that emissions need to be reduced by 50% to pre-2005 levels. There was not a single mention of ""no windows"" anywhere as the claim states. Therefore, this claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What is Joe Biden's net zero carbon emissions plan by 2030?
A: The Biden administration has committed to reduce those emissions 50% by 2030 below 2005 levels. That’s a critical first step of a global energy transition that must achieve net-zero emissions by midcentury to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 F) and thereby avert the worst impacts of climate change.. 

Q: What is the specific buildings plan?
A: A net-zero emissions building portfolio by 2045, including a 50 percent emissions reduction by 2032..

A: Border Patrol agents apprehended about half as many migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal 2020 as they did the year before, according to newly released federal data. The sharp drop in the number of apprehended migrants follows a virtual shutdown of the border and new restrictions in the way asylum cases are handled in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Following a dramatic rise in fiscal 2019, apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell by about half in fiscal 2020 as COVID-19 closed borders. There were 400,651 apprehensions in the 2020 fiscal year (October 2019-September 2020), a 53% decrease from the previous fiscal year, when apprehensions soared to their highest level in 12 years.. 

Q: What happened to immigration numbers in 2020
A: After surging in 2019, migrant apprehensions at U.S.-Mexico border fell sharply in fiscal 2020.

averitec_327,"Fact Check: The Biden-Sanders agenda proposes to end cash bail, releasing dangerous criminal...","Claim: The Biden-Sanders agenda proposes to end cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto US streets.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The proposal is to end cash bail, unless the person is deemed dangerous or likely to skip court.

Evidence:

Q: Do the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force recommendations support ending cash bail?
A: Democrats support eliminating the use
of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees.. 

Q: Is the End Cash Bail proposal aimed at dangerous criminals?
A: No. Such concerns led California to make the controversial decision in August 2018 to eliminate cash bail altogether, a move that the bail bond industry blocked pending a 2020 statewide referendum. In the new system, judges would detain defendants pretrial only if they are deemed dangerous or likely to skip court.

Q: Are there states that don't have the authority to determine if someone is dangerous for pre-trial release?
A: Thanks to a 1971 law, New York is the only state in the country where judges don’t have the authority to consider a person’s possible “dangerousness” in determining the conditions of their release before trial. When reform negotiations in the state began and the door was opened to modifying that system, some lawmakers wanted to add dangerousness as a sanctioned factor for pre-trial release, in exchange for the total abolition of bail in the state. Progressive reformers bristled—arguing that too often, judges ascribe dangerousness in ways that amplify the racial discrimination that pervades the justice system. Ultimately, they pursued a compromise that did not add dangerousness but preserved bail only for the most serious crimes..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems from the last QA that the testing did not stop, it was the reporting that became less frequent, therefore the label is refuted

Evidence:

Q: Did the US stop testing for H1n1?
A: Individual case counts were kept early during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak when the 2009 H1N1 virus first emerged. As the outbreak expanded and became more widespread, individual case counts become increasingly impractical and not representative of the true extent of the outbreak. This isbecause only a small proportion of persons with respiratory illness are actually tested and confirmed for influenza (including 2009 H1N1) so the true benefit of keeping track of these numbers is questionable. In addition, the extensive spread of 2009 H1N1 flu within the United States made it extremely resource-intensive for states to count individual cases. On July 24, 2009, CDC discontinued reporting of individual cases of 2009 H1N1, but continued to track hospitalizations and deaths.. 

Q: What was WHO's stance on H1N1 testing?
A: For all of these reasons, WHO will no longer issue the global tables showing the numbers of confirmed cases for all countries. However, as part of continued efforts to document the global spread of the H1N1 pandemic, regular updates will be provided describing the situation in the newly affected countries. WHO will continue to request that these countries report the first confirmed cases and, as far as feasible, provide weekly aggregated case numbers and descriptive epidemiology of the early cases.. 

Q: Did the Obama administration stopped testing during the H1N1, Swine Flu, pandemic.
A: On July 24, 2009, the Obama administration did not stopped testing during the H1N1, rather CDC discontinued reporting of individual cases of 2009 H1N1, but continued to track hospitalizations and deaths..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: It appears from the Q&As that there is conflicting evidence with regards to the use of Hydroxychloroquine. As some reports have found it works whilst some haven't.

Evidence:

Q: What is hydroxychloroquine?
A: Hydroxychloroquine belongs to the family of medicines called “antimalarials” (AMs), which are also classified as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, or DMARDs. These drugs were initially used to prevent and to treat malaria but are no longer used for those purposes and are now often used for lupus.. 

Q: Has hydroxychloroquine been used to treat COVID-19?
A: There was some early off-label use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. 

Q: Is there a study showing 50% reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine?
A: Yes. A study from the Henry Ford Health System in Michigan did show a 50% reduction in the risk of death in those who received hydroxychloroquine vs other drugs like azithromycin

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks..

Deb Group Ltd has sought advice on this matter from the Muslim Council of Britain
and the NHS, and has been given the following guidelines.

Muslims in the UK should not be concerned about using alcohol based sanitisers on
their skin because:

1. Any alcohol sold for use on the skin is rendered undrinkable, by law.

2. The issue of alcohol in the Muslim faith relates to the drinking of alcohol, and
not its use in other ways, such as the disinfection of skin.

3. Muslims are permitted to use alcohol based sanitisers for alleviating illness or
improving health.

4. The Muslim Food Board (UK) has confirmed that the use of alcohol based
sanitisers is permitted by their scholars.

5. For further reassurance, there is evidence to show that when using a sanitiser
the amount of alcohol absorbed through the skin is negligible.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the 1st QA it is evident that the call was made for a statue in Tennessee, therefore the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: DID TAYLOR SWIFT CALL FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY?
A: But there is no evidence Swift has called for such action. No statement about the Statue of Liberty being removed could be found on Swift’s social media pages. When reached for comment, a representative for Swift directed the Daily Caller to a USA Today article debunking the claim.

G1 does not appear to have published the article featured in the Facebook post. A search of the G1 website turned up no articles about Swift and the Statue of Liberty. The use of the Portuguese phrase “Atualizado ha 1 hora” in the screen grab, while the rest appears in English, indicates it is likely photoshopped.

While there is no record of Swift calling for the Statue of Liberty’s removal, she did ask the state of Tennessee to remove the statues of “racist historical figures” in a June 12 tweet..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Its obvious from the answers that the PCR test can be used for virus detection, so the claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: Can a PCR detect the Coronavirus?
A: There are two types of tests that detect SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material, or RNA: PCR tests and isothermal amplification, or IA, tests. Because RNA is made up of nucleic acids, both PCR and IA tests are also called nucleic acid amplification technology, or NAAT, tests. PCR tests are considered the gold-standard of NAAT testing.. 

Q: How accurate is a PCR test in detecting Coronavirus?
A: RT-PCR tests are considered the gold standard for detecting many viruses, and a number of companies are making them. Researchers at the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a nonprofit research center in Geneva, tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100% sensitivity on positive samples, and at least 96% specificity on negative samples in a laboratory setting..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Q&As do not verify the claim as stated.  Two of the source answers are from Twitter accounts, without any further confirmation that the information is correct. And the last Q&A answer is unrelated to the question and the claim.

Evidence:

Q: What is the law referred to in the claim?
A: The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 

Q: When was this law enacted?
A: 30/06/2020.

averitec_414,Fact Check: The next major advantage of the pandemic for the Deep State was the case made to...,"Claim: The next major advantage of the pandemic for the Deep State was the case made to the public for mail-in voting, a highly insecure practice proven to be rampant with fraud.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Mail-in voting is a safe and secure way for people to cast their votes 

Evidence:

Q: Is mail-in voting safe and secure?
A: U.S. citizens will vote by mail this year in record numbers. In the face of a global health
emergency, election officials across the country from both parties are working heroically to ensure
that voting by mail is accurate, accessible, safe & secure.. 

Q: What measures are taken to ensure mail-in voting does not lead to fraud?
A: Current and former election officials in vote-by-mail states said their systems are designed specifically to mitigate these risks, starting with a regular stream of mail contact with voters to establish that the address listed for them on the rolls is accurate. The ERIC system, as well as regular checks against DMV, death and other records, flag voter registration entries that may need updating. Federal law also requires states to conduct basic list maintenance.

Once voting begins, the linchpin of the process is a ballot return envelope, which typically requires the voter’s signature and includes a unique bar code linked to that voter’s record. When the ballot is returned and the bar code is scanned, no other ballot can be cast by that voter for that election.

Election officials and security experts said certain measures are important for preventing fraud in mail voting, such as accurate voter rolls and a method of authenticating ballots such as signature matching. Such safeguards have been put in place over time in the five states that currently run universal mail elections: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

The other mainstay of election security in vote-by-mail states is the signature verification process. Election workers are trained by law enforcement agencies to detect when a signature on the ballot envelope does not match signatures in a voter’s file. Discrepancies trigger a review that could end with a voter proving his or her identity — or being reported to law enforcement for possible ballot tampering.

All-mail states have implemented a range of other safeguards to ensure ballots are secure at all times, including dropboxes under 24-hour surveillance cameras, rules that two people be present with any ballot from the moment of receipt or collection, and detailed logs and reconciliation rules that require votes to be accounted for, down to the ballot..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The president did not personally fine the people who attended the party so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Did President Geingob host a party to mark his political party’s (SWAPO) 60th birthday during a coronavirus lockdown in Namibia?
A: Yes. The South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO) birthday party took place in parliament on April 19, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings were banned to limit the spread of coronavirus.

Q: Have the people who attended the gathering to mark SWAPO’s 60th birthday been fined?
A: Yes. The president said that less than 10 people attended the event, including the Vice President, the Prime Minister and party’s Secretary General. All have since been fined Sh12,000 ($115).

Q: Did President Geingob directly issue the fines to those who attended SWAPO’s 60th birthday party or were they issued by law enforcement agencies representing the Namibian government?
A: Namibia’s President Hage Geingob on Thursday admitted to breaching coronavirus regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party’s 60th anniversary and subsequently fining all the guests who attended..

Whilst Q&A 4 and 5 state Columbia is the largest producer of illegal drugs And smugglers use  ports of entry in the U.S to bring them in not the democrats as claimed.

Evidence:

Q: What is a Deep State?
A: Political scientists and foreign policy experts have used the term deep state for years to describe individuals and institutions who exercise power independent of—and sometimes over—civilian political leaders.. 

Q: Does a Deep State exist in America?
A: Whether any of this means there is a deep state in America depends on your definition. Powerful bureaucrats with access to government secrets and trusted media friends certainly do try to influence presidents from the shadows. But in Washington, at least, their views and goals are not monolithic. And unlike their counterparts in the developing world, they do tend to execute the orders they’re given by the president, however grudgingly—and are committed to upholding the rule of law.. 

Q: Did the Democrats and the Deep state do anything to create the narcotics epidemic in the USA?
A: They signed the 1994 Crime Bill which increased mass incarceration. They did not increase narcotic use to achieve this but instead became tougher on existing crime leading to more imprisonment..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show they are not meaningless, they may not be 100% accurate, but do help in the fight against covid

Evidence:

Q: Are COVID-19 (Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests accurate?
A: a nonprofit research center in Geneva, tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100% sensitivity on positive samples, and at least 96% specificity on negative samples in a laboratory setting.. 

Q: Are PCR tests accurate in real world settings?
A: In the real world, testing conditions and process are far from perfect, and accuracy suffers. Researchers still don’t know what the real-world false positive rate is, but clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR tests ranges from 66% to 80%. That means nearly one in three infected people who are tested will receive false negative results.. 

Q: Are PCR tests useful in the fight against Covid 19?
A: Yes. Advantages of PCR Testing
 Valuable for detecting specific pathogens that are difficult to culture in vitro or require a
long cultivation period
 Significantly more rapid in providing results compared to culturing
o Enables earlier informed decision making
o Rapid diagnosis of bacteraemia, particularly for low levels of bacteria in specimens
 Useful in detecting cases in extra pulmonary specimens which may be missed by smear
and/or culture
 Valuable screening tool
o PCR is still considered an adjunct test for certain diagnostic tests that still rely on
smear and culture, such as tuberculosis

averitec_422,Fact Check: Keir Starmer stopped Jimmy Savile being charged in 2009.,"Claim: Keir Starmer stopped Jimmy Savile being charged in 2009.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The QAs show that there were a series of ""blunders"" in which allegations against Savile were not followed through. Therefore Keir Starmer cannot be held responsible.

Evidence:

Q: Why didn't Keir Starmer prosecute Jimmy Savile ?
A: On the request of Starmer, Alison Levitt, his then Principal Legal Adviser, released a report in 2013 on the 2009 decision not to prosecute Savile. It found that if prosecutors had taken a different approach then prosecution may indeed have been possible. Levitt found that Surrey Police did not tell the victims that other complaints had been made against Savile also, and that had they known this, victims would have been more likely to press charges.

The report also discovered a ‘lack of understanding’ by officers concerning the law and practice, concerning sexual offences. It was found that outdated regulations and training were partially to blame in the failure to prosecute Savile, indicating structural issues in the way officers were trained, rather than being a matter of personal responsibility.. 

Q: Was there blunders by the  police and lawyers during the prosecution of Jimmy Savile ?
A: Britain’s chief prosecutor apologised for the failure to pursue four separate allegations against the BBC star, one made as recently as four years ago.

Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said there were failures by police in Sussex and Surrey and by the principal lawyer in dealing with the allegations. He issued a personal apology for the mistakes by the Crown Prosecution Service and announced a series of changes to improve the investigation of allegations by child victims.. 

Q: Did Keir Starmer helped Jimmy Savile to escape justice?
A: In 2008 (a few months before Starmer became director of public prosecutions [DPP] at the CPS) Sussex Police launched an investigation into a possible sexual assault, but took no further action as the complainant did not wish to give evidence.  In 2009 the CPS reviewed four sexual assault claims against Savile and felt there was insufficient evidence with which to proceed - again, because none of Savile's accusers were prepared to support police action. Frankly, the CPS makes a lot of decisions like this and it would be strange for the director himself to make the decision personally - that's the responsibility of the reviewing lawyer. We may well question that decision, but asking whether there was in fact sufficient evidence is one thing; to assume that such evidence would have resulted in a conviction is quite another. Have any of us seen the evidence the CPS was presented with?  Have those spinning these accusations - or spreading them - actually spoken with any of those who brought the initial complaints against Savile? Starmer took over a CPS under fire on various fronts and, after 2011, especially on the Savile issue. While he had no personal involvement in the decision not to proceed, Starmer did commission a review, headed by Alison Levitt QC, in which he revealed failures at the heart of the CPS and in 2013 issued an apology. He acknowledged those failures, pledging to change the culture of the CPS and its internal mechanisms. A ""fundamental shift"" was required, he argued, as ""we cannot afford another Savile moment in five or ten years. While ""no improper motives"" were found, the Evening Standard reported that one of the review's major criticisms was that ""the CPS lawyer (my italics) should have challenged the police conclusions and sought to build a prosecution against Savile"". It also suggested the complainants should have been informed that there had been other complaints about Savile, as this would potentially have encouraged them to give evidence. This.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: From the Q&A it seems the claim is true and this is backed up by the census data. 

Evidence:

Q: Does the average American spend more on hospital bills than on tax to the IRS?
A: Overall, as a country, Americans spent $1.2 trillion on hospital care in 2018. That’s over $3,600 for every man, woman, and child in the U.S. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services project that, by 2026, hospital spending will rise to $1.8 trillion: over $5,300 per person.
it’s more than the average family pays in federal taxes. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 cut the federal tax rate for a family of median income from 14.6 percent to 13.8 percent. That includes income taxes, payroll taxes, and every other federal tax that applies to middle-class families.
That is to say, the average family now hands over more of its paycheck to the hospital industry than it does to the federal government in taxes.. 

Q: Is there any data to back up this claim?
A: Yes. According to the Census

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Yes this claim is supported, a surcharge is being added to bills due to Covid.

Evidence:

Q: Are businesses in the USA adding a covid surcharge to bills?
A: Yes. Facing higher costs to keep workers and customers safe and an indefinite period of suppressed demand, businesses are navigating an ever-narrower path to profitability. To make the math work, some businesses are cutting services and jobs. Others are raising prices, including imposing coronavirus-related fees aimed at getting customers to share some of the expenses.

Q: What is a covid surcharge?
A: With businesses around the country reopening, customers may notice an additional expense on their bill: a COVID-19 surcharge.

This new surcharge is popping up around the country and is an extra fee that businesses can add to a bill to help alleviate the financial burden placed upon them during the virus outbreak. It is meant to help offset losses due to businesses having to temporarily close, or help businesses keep up with the new requirements to reopen under health guidelines..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers and credible sources show that wearing masks do help in reducing transmission so the claim is refuted.

Q: Why are cloth masks worn?
A: Well-fitting disposable surgical masks offer more protection than cloth or other woven masks, but less protection than respirators but cloth masks are better for the environment as they are reusable and do not contribute to landfill and useful when there is a mask shortage. 

Q: Are cloth masks effective in preventing the spread of viruses?
A: There is evidence to suggest that use of cloth face coverings by the public during a pandemic helps reduce disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well. Cloth face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these interventions..

A: Joint Statement issued on April 27, 2020:

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine (AAEM) jointly and emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi. These reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19. As owners of local urgent care clinics, it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public’s health.

COVID-19 misinformation is widespread and dangerous. Members of ACEP and AAEM are first-hand witnesses to the human toll that COVID-19 is taking on our communities. ACEP and AAEM strongly advise against using any statements of Drs. Erickson and Massihi as a basis for policy and decision making..

A: Generally, one time use (one patient encounter). 

Q: Do we need to change the the surgical masks every 20-30 minutes as it  traps the  covid virus and we can breath as well as spread it ?

A: Check the spelling and structure of the username: Fake Twitter accounts often use the real name, or something very similar, and the same photo as the genuine article, but the username is marginally different. 

Check the bio - what does it say?: Does it say spoof or parody or contain anything unusual that might set alarm bells ringing (see Felix Baumgartner, above)? According to Twitter’s terms of use, parody accounts are not discouraged but they are obliged to make this clear in the bio.  

Is the account verified?: Accounts with the official tick badge have been checked by Twitter and are who they purport to be.. 

Q: Is there a blue-tick verification on the alleged tweet from Angela Merkel in the claim?
A: No. There is no blue-tick verification in the claim tweet.

averitec_497,Fact Check: Pregnant women are not more susceptible to COVID-19.,"Claim: Pregnant women are not more susceptible to COVID-19.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: QA Pairs state that:

pregnant women with COVID-19 do not appear to be at increased risk 

While another says:
Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19
Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty in breathing) to their healthcare provider.

So other health factors seem to play a part.



Evidence:

Q: What is this claim based on?
A: Caring for Women Who Are Planning a Pregnancy, Pregnant, or Postpartum During the COVID-19 Pandemic. 

Q: What does the JAMA article say about pregnant women & Covid-19?
A: Since its recognition in China in December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly spread throughout the world and become a pandemic. Although considerable data on COVID-19 are available, much remains to be learned about its effects on pregnant women and newborns.

No data are currently available to assess whether pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease associated with other respiratory illnesses (eg, 2009 H1N1 influenza),1 but thus far, pregnant women with COVID-19 do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease compared with the general population. 

Q: What do the WHO guidelines say about the risks of Covid-19 for pregnant women?
A: Pregnant women or recently pregnant women who are  older, overweight, and have pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes seem to have an increased  risk of developing severe COVID-19
Due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections.

Justification: According to Facebook, If you share a photo on Facebook you automatically grant permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings). Facebook will not make private photos public.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Some can claim free school meals, and some can't. 

Evidence:

Q: What does ""no recourse to public funds"" mean?
A: No recourse to public funds (NRPF) is a standard condition applied to those staying here with a temporary immigration status to protect public funds. Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) is set as the general threshold for permitting migrants to access public funds. Migrants who are here without leave are also subject to no recourse to public funds. Therefore, most migrants do not have access to public funds as a matter of course.. 

Q: During the pandemic do children from NRPF groups have access to free school meals?
A: Some of them do:-
During the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, we are temporarily extending free school meal eligibility to include some children of groups who have no recourse to public funds (NRPF).

These groups are:

children of Zambrano carers
children of families with no recourse to public funds with a right to remain in the UK on grounds of private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights

Not effective in those 



Evidence:

Q: What research has been conducted into the effectiveness of dexamethosone as a COVID-19 treatment?
A: The British Government clinical trial tested six treatment options as part of its RECOVERY trial. One of these was dexamethosone.. 

Q: What did the government's RECOVERY trial find out about the effectiveness of dexamethosone as a COVID-19 treatment?
A: Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients (rate ratio 0.65 [95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.88]; p=0.0003) and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only (0.80 [0.67 to 0.96]; p=0.0021). There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support (1.22 [0.86 to 1.75]; p=0.14).

Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone.. 

Q: What have medical professionals said about the use of dexamethasone against the coronavirus?
A: Department of Health on Wednesday advised the public to be cautious in interpreting the preliminary study findings that steroid drug dexamethasone can reduce the risk of the sickest patients dying from coronavirus disease.

DOH expressed concern that this discovery might lead people to ‘think it is a magic pill for COVID-19.’.

Q: What is Juneteenth?
A: The tradition started in 1866 in Texas and spread to nearby states.

The Civil Rights movement infused Juneteenth with new energy.

Today, 47 states recognize the day.. 

Q: Where does Juneteenth stem from?
A: Juneteenth is the oldest known celebration of African American freedom, marking the ending of slavery in the U.S. 
It commemorates the week in June 1865 that Major Gen. Gordon Granger led the Union soldiers to Galveston, Texas, declaring the war was over and the enslaved could go free. 
While President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation officially freed slaves more than two years earlier, it was the surrender of General Lee in April 1865 and Granger’s arrival with the troops that created a force strong enough to overcome Texas’ resistance to the executive order to free slaves. 
The culmination of Granger’s trip led to his June 19 reading of the proclamation, coined as “Juneteenth” — the day the freed slaves and their families recounted memories, reassured each other of a newly-promised future and gathered in prayer..

averitec_514,Fact Check: An Expansion of Mail-in Ballots would increase the chance of theft in the USA.,"Claim: An Expansion of Mail-in Ballots would increase the chance of theft in the USA.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The QA cover a lot of ground in terms of information around voter fraud and mail in ballots, there good probing question and good answers which give a very good view of it and allow for a good decision on the claim. Based on the information gathered from the QA it appears the claim itself was made by Donald Trump, we know that he has a problem with mail in ballots as he often refers to them as being a method of rigging an election, the QA has found that Donald Trump himself however used a mail in absentee ballot to vote. Theres plenty of information from further QA to discover that theres lots of secure safeguards in place to both prevent voter fraud and it also prooves that someone is not possible to vote by mail then in person. For this claim I have therefore refuted it.

Evidence:

Q: Who made this claim about the potential for theft of mail in ballots?
A: Donald Trump. 

Q: Has Donald Trump voted by mail in ballot?
A: Trump voted earlier this year, in a no-excuse absentee vote state -- meaning that a voter can request an absentee ballot (aka one you fill out at home and mail back to the election authority) without offering any excuse for why they want to do so.
Which is what Trump did. Being president is a more than full-time job, and he couldn't make time to travel to Florida to cast a vote in person. So he voted absentee.. 

Q: How secure is mail in voting (absentee ballot voteing)?
A: Numerous safeguards are included in the absentee voting process. Absentee ballots are sent only to registered voters who request them using an official N.C. Absentee Ballot Request Form before the deadline. The request must be signed and include identifying information about the voter, including date of birth and driver’s license number or last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number. Voters must vote their ballot in the presence of two witnesses or a notary, and those witnesses must sign the absentee return envelope certifying that the voter marked their ballot and is the registered voter submitting the marked ballot.

Only the voter or their near relative or legal guardian may return the ballot. Upon return, the county board of elections reviews the absentee envelope to ensure compliance with the legal requirements. Once the ballot is accepted, that voter is marked in the system as having voted in that election.

Data on who has requested absentee ballots is now confidential until Election Day. Criminal penalties have been increased for absentee voting fraud-related offenses. Many people are watching our absentee voting process, including candidates, political parties, county boards of elections, and political and data scientists. If there are anomalies or questionable activities, they will be identified by or reported to election officials.

Finally, the State Board of Elections has an Investigations Division that investigates credible allegations of elections fraud and refers cases to prosecutors when warranted by the evidence. The State Board also conducts several post-election audits which will catch inconsistencies that can then be investigated by the board or the Investigations Division..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Each state has their own process for voting  therefore the claim is ref5

Evidence:

Q: What are permissible reasons for absentee voting
A: a voter must be able to personally mark their own ballot and sign their name to the completed ballot security envelope and have a reason to request an absentee vote-by-mail ballot:

You have a specific, reasonable expectation that you will be absent from the county on Election Day during the entire 12 hours that the polls are open (6 am until 6 pm).
You have a disability.
You are at least 65 years of age.
You will have official election duties outside of your voting precinct.
You are scheduled to work at your regular place of employment during the entire 12 hours that the polls are open.
You will be confined due to illness or injury or you will be caring for an individual confined due to illness or injury during the entire 12 hours that the polls are open.

You are a participant in the state's address confidentiality program.
You are a member of the military or a public safety officer.
You are a ""serious sex offender"" as defined in Indiana Code 35-42-4-14(a).
You are prevented from voting due to the unavailability of transportation to the polls.. 

Q: Are there other processes involved in absentee voting asides the States recognized laws
A: No. Each state in the US has its own rules as regards absentee voting and where its permitted, the rules and requirements are not so different from each other

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A pair 2 state that a spokesperson for Black lives matter Scotland denied they had made or placed the posters as claimed, and 1st the Q&A pair also does mention the posters content being harefull which supports the claim also.

Evidence:

Q: What is Black Lives Matter?
A: The movement was born in 2013, after the man who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, was cleared of his murder. A Californian activist, Alicia Garza, responded to the jury’s decision on Facebook with a post that ended: “Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” The hashtag was born, and continued to grow in prominence with each new incident and protest.

The formal organization that sprung from the protests started with the goal of highlighting the disproportionate number of incidences in which a police officer killed a member of the black community. But it soon gained international recognition, after the death of Michael Brown in Missouri a year later.

Black Lives Matter now describes itself as a “chapter-based national organization working for the validity of black life”. It has developed to include the issues of black women and LGBT communities, undocumented black people and black people with disabilities.. 

Q: Has Black Lives Matter given any comments on alledged images with text attacking white people?
A: Yes. A spokesperson said: ""It has recently come to our attention at the African Community Edinburgh, the organisers of the Black Lives Matter protest at Holyrood Park, that posters and flyers have been produced with the heading 'shoot whites on sight, silence is violence' claiming to be from Black Lives Matter. 

""We categorically deny that these were created on our behalf and we denounce such hate speech.

""We are not affiliated with Antifa, or any political party, as we are a grassroots network mobilised to bring attention to the plight of black people worldwide in order to end institutionalised racism, state sanctioned violence and anti-black and brown racism.

Q: Is there any reports of Black Lives Matter antagonising white people with racial attacks?

Throughout the ancient world, anyone who functioned as a servant was usually a slave.

In the kind of servitude called slavery, the laborer is considered property. He or she can be bought and sold like any other commodity. The origins of slavery are unknown, but it probably emerged as an economic necessity or convenience when people began to establish permanent communities based on agriculture..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: 19.7% of african americans had jobs where they could work from home, which is close enough 

Evidence:

Q: What percentage of African Americans had jobs where they could work from home during COVID-19 ?
A: 17.6. 

Q: Did  COVID-19  Affected  Black/African Americans ?
A: Before the crisis hit, many Black and Latino workers held jobs done outside the home. Only 35.4 percent of Black adults and 25.2 percent of Latino adults reported they can do part of their work remotely, compared with 43.4 percent of white adults. Though reporting somewhat higher averages, these estimates largely correspond with earlier US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on racial and ethnic differences in the ability to work from home.

Differences in who can telework could indicate who’s at higher risk of losing a job, hours, or income. But despite multiple sources showing Black and Latino adults are less able to work from home compared with white adults, families of nonelderly Black adults experienced only minimally higher rates of job loss.

Black workers in particular are disproportionately employed in many of the jobs considered “essential,” suggesting Black workers may experience less drastic job losses than would be expected.

Justification: From the evidence given, it looks as though India's Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru has had connections with Playboy magazine regarding an interview. However, there were disputes over whether an interview even took place in the first place. There has been no investigation to determine the truth. Hence, this is conflicting evidence. 

Evidence:

Q: According to Forbes magazine, who has had interviews published in Playboy?
A: ...landing interviews with some of the world’s most prominent figures, including Malcom X, Fidel Castro, The Beatles, Martin Luther King Jr., Jimmy Hoffa, George Wallace, Henry Miller and Cassisus Clay. This was just in the first three years. The magazine would go on to interview President Jimmy Carter, among many others.. 

Q: Was Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister included in the list of interviewees?
A: But many will be surprised to learn that the first head-of-state to appear in Playboy’s controversial pages was not Castro or Carter, but Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister and most prominent founding father alongside Mahatma Gandhi.. 

Q: What was the subsequent retraction in the same issue of Playboy about this interview?
A: The same issue of the magazine carried an “editor’s note” on Page 3, which stated, “after the rest of the magazine had gone to press, we received word from the Indian Embassy in Washington that our interview with PM Nehru was not, in fact, the result of an exclusive, personal conversation with the head of the Indian state, but simply a gathering together of public pronouncements made by the Prime Minister in various speeches, statements, etc., over the past several years.”.

A: No. The plan is a long term plan to encourage the movement away from fossil fuels and towards more sustainable energy sources. ""he will demand that Congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency that: 1) establishes an enforcement mechanism that includes milestone targets no later than the end of his first term in 2025, 2) makes a historic investment in clean energy and climate research and innovation, 3) incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy, especially in communities most impacted by climate change.""

A: A spokesman for Mr. Biden’s campaign clarified that the former vice president wouldn’t ban fracking, which is now commonly used to produce natural gas and oil in key states with blue-collar voters like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Colorado. He was referring only to his stated policy to ban new permits for oil and gas drilling on federal land and offshore, the spokesman added..

averitec_616,"Fact Check: Hillary Clinton is on trial for the 2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi,...","Claim: Hillary Clinton is on trial for the 2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The first answer shows that Clinton was not on trial but was involved in the case so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Was Hillary Clinton put on trial for the 2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya?
A: A court case involving Clinton was in court, but she wasn’t on trial.. 

Q: Did the United States setup a House Committee to question Hillary Clinton over  2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya?
A: Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spent 11 hours answering questions from the House Benghazi Committee Thursday. At one point, the hearing devolved into a yelling match between Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy and Democrats on the committee.

The bickering followed Gowdy's questions regarding Clinton's email correspondence with Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton family friend and informal adviser. Democrats on the committee suggested Gowdy's line of questioning was unfair and politically motivated.

""If you think we've heard about Sidney Blumenthal, wait for the next round!"" Gowdy declared before abruptly calling a recess in the middle of the marathon hearing.

Gowdy questioned why Clinton exchanged so many emails with Blumenthal pertaining to Libya, even though Blumenthal ""could not get hired by our government... had never been to Libya, [and] had no expertise with Libya.""

    Hillary Clinton's Benghazi testimony: A viewer's guide
    What Hillary Clinton will say before the Benghazi panel

Gowdy suggested it was suspicious that Blumenthal, ""all the while working with the Clinton Foundation and some pseudo-news entities, had unfettered access to you."" By contrast, Gowdy said that Clinton's records showed ""not a single email to and from Ambassador [Chris] Stevens,"" the administration's trusted man on the ground in Libya and one of the four Americans killed in the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. facility in Benghazi.. 

Q: What did Hillary Clinton say about  the 2002 terror attack on Americans in Benghazi, Libya ?
A: The moment Hillary Clinton seemed to realize that her testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi was not going to be a big problem for her or for her campaign came about forty-five minutes in. When the hearing opened, she had regarded the chairman, Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, with irritated skepticism. She looked as if she might say something rash, if not throw something, and perhaps she might have. Nearly three years ago, in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Benghazi, she lashed out after having been asked many times about U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice’s comments on the Sunday talk shows about what had instigated the attack, on September 11, 2012, in which four Americans, including Chris Stevens, the Ambassador to Libya, died. “What difference, at this point, does it make?” Clinton demanded. Out of context, she sounded unmoved by the men’s deaths. Now, in the House hearing, it seemed to dawn on her that the proper response to her Republican interrogators was not outrage but pity.

Peter Roskam, of Illinois, was laying out a scenario in which Clinton’s assumption of a leadership role on Libyan policy “didn’t come easy,” when he stopped and said, in case he might be overwhelming her, “I can pause while you’re reading your notes from your staff.” Clinton replied, “I can do more than one thing at a time, Congressman—thanks.” A minute or two later, Roskam said, “Go ahead and read the note if you need to.” This time, Clinton laughed. “I’m not done with my question,” Roskam said; he was just doing her a “courtesy.” “That’s all right,” Clinton responded, with a friendly wave of her hand. From then on, she was in control. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, Congressman. I can only tell you what the facts are,” she told Jim Jordan, of Ohio, who is the chairman of the Freedom Caucus. As he spoke, she rested her chin on the palm of one hand, as if he were not much more than a loud boor at a party who, puzzlingly, doesn’t seem to kn.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A pairs explain it was a user created problem rather than an algorithm one at Instagram's end.

Evidence:

Q: What happened on Instagram on June 2 2020 with #blackouttuesday and #blacklivesmatter hashtags?
A: Instagram users flooded the platform with black squares in support of black victims of police violence as part of a Blackout Tuesday protest. As of 11:45 a.m. ET, more than 14.6 million Instagram posts used the hashtag #BlackoutTuesday.. 

Q: Why did users think that the Instagram algorithm was merging #BlackOutTuesday posts with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag?
A: People used hashtags meant for Black Lives Matter, which usually is related to global protests and donations, on their black squares. That caused the usual #BLM and #BlackLivesMatter pages to be flooded with simple squares rather than information and resources, leading users to believe Instagram had merged their posts.. 

Q: What was Instagram's explanation for the users thinking that the #BLM and #BlackLivesMatter, and #BlackOutTuesday hashtags had been merged?
A: Instagram explained to USA TODAY that because the “Most Recent"" section of the hashtag page shows posts reverse chronologically, a rush of new ""Blackout Tuesday"" posts can bury older #BlackLivesMatter and #BLM posts..

Evidence:

Q: Can animals catch COVID-19?

Q: Did a dog test positive for COVID-19?
A: Yes. The Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed earlier this week that a case of COVID-19 has infected a German shepherd in New York.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Evidence finds that President Donald Trump's new executive order, which would target social media companies, is a violation of the First Amendment and free speech protections.

Evidence:

Q: Was President Trump executive order on Social media companies a violation of the First Amendment and free speech protections ?
A: Rather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.”. 

Q: Was the Trump's Executive Order a threat to future online speech ?
A: ARTICLE 19 has condemned US President Donald Trump’s use of an Executive Order designed to force social media companies into moderating content as he sees fit. 

Executive Director Quinn McKew said:

“The use of an Executive Order to undermine key speech protections online threatens the internet as we know it.  

“For the President  to claim that he is doing this in the name of free speech is disingenuous at best.  Fact checking is not censorship, it is more speech. This is a clear attempt to push  companies into moderating content in line with the President’s interpretation of free speech, ahead of a divisive presidential election where social media will be a key campaigning battleground.”

The Executive Order seeks to undermine protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This shields online intermediaries from liability for what their users say and protects intermediaries’ ability to moderate content on their  platforms. Intermediaries include Internet Service Providers and social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Platforms also have their own free speech rights and their editorial functions are protected under the First Amendment.

McKew added: “Rather than protecting free speech, undermining Section 230 in this way will restrict more speech online. It will make it easier for the government itself to exert the levers of censorship, fundamentally undermining First Amendment rights in the United States.”

The row between Twitter and the President looks set to intensify after the social media platform marked tweets which threatened the use of force in the wake of civil unrest in Minneapolis as in violation of rules about glorifying violence. This is the first time Twitter uses such a label against a head of state and the US President in particular. In line with Twitter policy, the tweet was not removed as Twitter said it might be in the public interest but the public interest notice “limits the ability to engage with the Tweet. 

Q: Can Social media companies be sued under Trump's Executive Order ?
A: The social media executive order makes it easier for companies like Twitter, Facebook and Google to be held liable for the content posted on their platforms, according to a draft obtained by ABC News..

averitec_638,Fact Check: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a domestic Terrorist ...,"Claim: The United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a domestic Terrorist Organization.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Correct claim

Evidence:

Q: Is there a current legal authority in the U.S. for designating a domestic organization as a terrorist organization?
A: No. “No current legal authority exists for designating domestic organizations as terrorist organizations. Any attempt at such a designation would raise significant First Amendment concerns.”

@GeorgetownICAP’s Mary McCord

Q: Have concerns been raised about designating a domestic organization as a terrorist organization?
A: Yes. ""designation of a domestic organization as a terrorist organization would raise serious concerns about infringing on First Amendment rights and cause legitimate fears that the designation tool could be used wrongly to target unpopular ideologies"". written by Mary B. McCord and Jason M. Blazakis , director of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies’ Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism.

Q: What is the Antifa Organization?
A: Antifa is short for anti-fascists. The term is used to define a broad group of people whose political beliefs lean toward the left – often the far left – but do not conform with the Democratic Party platform. The group doesn’t have an official leader or headquarters, although groups in certain states hold regular meetings.

Antifa positions can be hard to define, but many members support oppressed populations and protest the amassing of wealth by corporations and elites. Some employ radical or militant tactics to get their message across..

averitec_640,Fact Check: Ear loop face masks don't protect against Covid-19.,"Claim: Ear loop face masks don't protect against Covid-19.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: they may not full protect but they offer some protection.

Evidence:

Q: How do masks help with the spread of Covid-19?
A: A well-fitting mask keeps the virus from reaching others. It can also protect the wearer from becoming infected. Also, masks stop people from touching their mouths and faces.. 

Q: Is there any benefit to wearing an ear loop face mask to help prevent catching or spreading covid 19?
A: Yes while they might not prevent you from catching the virus they assist in stopping the spread by catching the majority of droplets.


From Source page:

""cloth masks are also effective at reducing the spread of these smaller particles""

""We can see directly that a piece of cloth blocks those droplets and the virus those droplets contain. People without symptoms who don’t even know they are sick are responsible for around half of the transmission of the virus.""

""This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets."".

averitec_642,Fact Check: Kenya's president said ' we have connected 99% of all schools to electricty',"Claim: Kenya's president said ' we have connected 99% of all schools to electricty'

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The figure would have been accurate if it is just referring to public primary schools and does not include Pre-primary and Secondary schools.

Evidence:

Q: Who electrifies schools in Kenya?
A: This is a shared responsibility between the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Corporation and state utility Kenya Power, according to energy ministry spokesperson Moses Nyandika.. 

Q: how many were electrified by 2016?
A: Before 2013, the rural electrification agency focused on secondary schools, according to its 2016-2021 strategic plan. Some 6,530 of these had been electrified by June 2013, when Kenyatta’s administration started its first full financial year.
The agency then turned its focus to primary schools to support the new government’s digital learning plan. By June 2016 it had connected 8,259 secondary schools, and 22,648 of 23,401 public primary schools targeted, according to the strategic plan.. 

Q: How many were connected as of 2020?
A: A spokesperson for the agency told Africa Check it has connected 22,927 public primary schools. This was 98.4% of the total number of public primary schools as of 2019.

The agency also told Africa Check some 8,755 public secondary schools, polytechnics and institutions of higher learning were connected as of 2020. But it did not break down this data further to allow us to calculate what percentage of secondary schools have been electrified.For early childhood development and education centres, some 204 have been provided with electricity, the agency said. This is less than 1%, or 0.7% specifically, of the 28,383 early childhood centres captured by the national statistics office for 2020.

The president’s figure would therefore have been accurate if he were referring only to public primary schools. Before his administration, some 6,530 secondary schools had already been connected, so he cannot take credit for them.

Available data also shows at least 99% of early childhood centres are not yet connected to electricity..

averitec_645,"Fact Check: If you wear a surgical mask for a long time, you will start feeling weak.","Claim: If you wear a surgical mask for a long time, you will start feeling weak.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Some evidence supports the claim (caused adverse effects such as headaches, rash, acne, etc.), but some refutes it.

Evidence:

Q: Have people reported feeling weak after wearing a surgical face mask over a prolonged period of time?
A: Yes. While the weather may be getting cooler, which makes wearing a mask a little more comfortable than in the heat, many still find masks can make them feel faint over prolonged periods. As Dr. Hideki Taniguchi, a dehydration specialist, told the Financial Times back in 2020: ""[Wearing a mask] stops cool air coming in, which raises the temperature especially above the neck; it retains humidity, so the throat becomes dry and people forget to drink.""

Q: What research is there to support the claim that wearing surgical face masks over a prolonged period of time can lead to feelings of weakness or similar side effects?
A: Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock has highlighted a number of studies linking prolonged mask use to headaches and lowered blood oxygen levels, which can weaken the immune system.
The side effects vary depending on whether they are cloth or paper surgical masks or N95 respirator masks because the N95, being a more effective filter, also limits breathing to a greater degree, and is therefore more commonly associated with headaches, Blaylock reported.
…A third study measured the blood oxygen of 53 surgeons using an oximeter before and after surgery.
""The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels,"" Blaylock wrote.
The potential for masks to reduce oxygen levels in the wearer are important not only because this can lead to passing out, but also because they have been linked to reduced natural immunity.. 

Q: Are there ways to prevent negative side effects such as feeling weak when wearing face masks?
A: For those who aren’t medically exempt, but find wearing a mask uncomfortable, there are ways to make the experience feel more manageable:
- Opt for breathable materials
- Make sure it fits
- Carry extras if available
- Limit how long you wear one.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Office for National Statistics, in 2020 gave a concise answer. From the records it shows that it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.

Evidence:

Q: At the time of this claim, what percentage of covid cases were children vs adults?
A: Studies have shown that between 1% and 5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are children, but many children may be undiagnosed because up to a third of infected children never develop any symptoms.. 

Q: Are children as likely to transmit the virus as adults?
A: Current UK data suggest that they are as likely as adults to become infected and carry the virus but they may be less likely than adults to transmit the virus because, for instance, adults are contagious for longer than children (Office for National Statistics, 2020).”. 

Q: What does current evidence suggest about transmission rates in children?
A: Data on viral loads were scarce, but indicated that children may have lower levels than adults, partly because they often have fewer symptoms, and this should decrease the transmission risk. Household transmission studies showed that children were rarely the index case and case studies suggested that children with COVID-19 seldom caused outbreaks. However, it is highly likely that children can transmit the SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and even asymptomatic children can have viral loads..

averitec_657,Fact Check: Hand sanitizer bottle can catch fire when left in a hot vehicle,"Claim: Hand sanitizer bottle can catch fire when left in a hot vehicle

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the evidence found it seems that the bottle keeps the hand sanitizer vapors in. If it was stored in an open container - even then the car would have to get very hot up to 80 degrees Celsius and the hand sanitizer at 400 C to ""auto-ignite"".  You would also need an ignition source. 

Evidence:

Q: What is in hand sanitizer?
A: Hand sanitizers are usually composed of around 60 to 70 percent ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, according to Cocco. The US National Center for Biotechnology Information says the flashpoint for ethanol is 55 F (12.8 C) and 53 F for isopropyl alcohol.. 

Q: Are hand sanitizer bottles marked as flammable?
A: Yes. Several hand sanitizer products researched by AFP are marked flammable. Health Canada requires that alcohol-based hand sanitizers carry a flammability warning: ""Keep away from open flame and sources of heat.

Q: Are they likely to ignite in a hot car?
A: Hand sanitizers are most commonly used in bottles with a cap or a pump, so the vapors are contained and cannot find an ignition source. If the liquid were stored in an open container in a car, it could theoretically produce vapors. However, ""you still need an ignition source,"" and Cocco says ""parked cars really don't have a lot of ignition sources."" Cocco adds that the only way the vapors could breach a closed bottle ""is if it reaches boiling point, which is very high, on average 80 degrees Celsius."" He further explained that the hand sanitizer would have to reach 400 C to ""auto-ignite..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: 146 out of 156 countries had lower death rates than the USA's 30. It's clearly false to say ""most places"" have twice the USA's death rate.

Evidence:

Q: How does mortality from COVID-19 differ across countries?
A: One of the most important ways to measure the burden of COVID-19 is mortality. Countries throughout the world have reported very different case fatality ratios – the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases.. 

Q: How could differences in COVID-19 mortality numbers be caused?
A: Differences in the number of people tested: With more testing, more people with milder cases are identified. This lowers the case-fatality ratio.

Demographics: For example, mortality tends to be higher in older populations.

Characteristics of the healthcare system: For example, mortality may rise as hospitals become overwhelmed and have fewer resources.

Other factors, many of which remain unknown.. 

Q: What is the date of the claim?
A: The claim was made on 27th May 2020..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The third source shows that there is a correlation between vitamin D and covid deaths. The source is a credible one. Therefore the claim is supported.

Evidence:

Q: What does vitamin D do?
A: Aside from building healthy bones, vitamin D can boost the immune system by suppressing what’s called a cytokine storm — severe inflammation that occurs when the immune system becomes overactive and releases too many cytokine proteins.. 

Q: How might this help COVID-19?
A: Backman said cytokine storms may contribute to COVID-19 deaths because the storms can damage people’s lungs. An April 17, 2020 article on WebMD also indicated that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had high levels of cytokines in their system.

The idea, then, is that vitamin D could suppress a catastrophic immune response and prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms that lead to death.. 

Q: Is the link between lower vitamin D levels and deaths from COVID-19 backed by research?
A: Early studies into vitamin D suggests it may curb the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and reduce mortality rates. Further research is needed to examine the issue, and vitamin D is not a cure for the coronavirus. 

But Grothman did not say it was a cure, only that there was a correlation. One expert noted the correlation was ""significant"".

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The third Q&A show that the increase is 20% so the claim is supported.

Evidence:

Q: What is the reason for farm bankruptcies in the US
A: Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies continue to increase as farmers and ranchers struggle with a prolonged downturn in the farm economy that’s been made worse by unfair retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture as well as two consecutive years of adverse planting, growing and harvesting conditions.. 

Q: Did it come as a surprise
A: The continued increase in Chapter 12 filings was not unanticipated given the multi-year downturn in the farm economy, record farm debt, headwinds on the trade front and recent changes to the bankruptcy rules in 2019’s Family Farmer Relief Act, which raised the debt ceiling to $10 million. 

Q: What does the data show regarding farm bankruptcy rates in the USA in 2019?
A: The number of family farms filing for bankruptcy last year jumped nearly 20% from the previous year, according to data released by the U.S. Courts.

According to American Farm Bureau Federation Chief Economist John Newton, last year there were 595 Chapter 12 family farm bankruptcies, up nearly 100 filings from 2018 and the highest level since 2011’s 637 Chapter 12 filings..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is no evidence that the quote was said. In other interviews she has made remarks but not about abortion in the 9th month so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What has Amy Mcgrath said about her views on abortion?
A: So right now, you can't walk into a clinic eight months pregnant and get an abortion, you can't do it and that's reasonable.. 

Q: What did Amy McGrath say about the government's stance on abortions
A: “You don’t think there should be any limitations at all on abortion?” asked host Larry Glover on 590 WVLK.

“I don’t think government should be involved in making a decision on a woman’s body,” McGrath said.. 

Q: Did she make another statement as regards abortions
A: But like many Kentuckians, I don't think government should be the deciding factor. I think there are enough restrictions on abortion and they're reasonable. So right now, you can't walk into a clinic eight months pregnant and get an abortion, you can't do it and that's reasonable. I believe we already have reasonable laws, and I'm very concerned about what's happening in other states like Alabama and Georgia where they're trying to criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest and the life of the mother. This is not a government decision. It's a family decision and a very personal decision..

averitec_701,"Fact Check: While California is dying … Gavin (Newsom) is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!","Claim: While California is dying … Gavin (Newsom) is vacationing in Stevensville, MT!

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Governor Gavin Newsom of California encouraged people to stay at home. In California at the time of the stay-at-home order, 19 people had died and over 900 had tested positive for coronavirus. However, it is not clear whether Newsom went on vacation, as the last question links back to a fact-checking website. As a result, there is insufficient reliable evidence on whether Newsom vacationed in  Stevensville, MT. 

Evidence:

Q: Did California Governor Gavin Newsom issued stay-at-home order ?
A: All Californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered Thursday. “It’s time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,” he said at an evening press conference. Newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging Californians to influence one another to do the right thing.. 

Q: What is the population of people that were affected by California Governor Gavin Newsom stay-at-home order ?
A: The nation's most populous state is ordering its nearly 40 million residents to stay home to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Nineteen people have died and more than 900 tested positive for coronavirus in California.. 

Q: Did any county defies California Governor Gavin Newsom Stay-at-Home Order ?
A: Defiance came with biscuits and gravy as a remote California county became the first to buck Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order.

Modoc County moved Friday to reopen hair salons, churches, restaurants and the county’s only movie theater. There haven’t been any confirmed cases of COVID-19 among 9,000 residents, but the reopening came with strict social distancing limits. Businesses could only have half the patrons, and customers must stay 6 feet apart.

The county is an outlier in every sense of the word. It is tucked into the far northeast near the Oregon border, hundreds of miles from the capital of Sacramento and even further politically from the Democrat-controlled state; it’s a place where seven in 10 voted for Donald Trump in 2016..

According to NewsGuard the site does not maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability. 

Q: Does the story relate to anything Bill Gates actually said?
A: What Gates really said was that making a vaccine that is effective in older people is ""a huge challenge"" because flu vaccines are less effective for the elderly.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The current state budget of Texas will be billions of dollars out of balance.

Evidence:

Q: How balanced was Texas' budget in 2020?
A: Abbott, Patrick and Bonnen made clear in Wednesday's letter that ""it may become necessary to make additional budget adjustments"" as the state's revenues continue to come into focus. Hegar, who is expected to provide his revised fiscal forecast in July, has already said that the current state budget will be billions of dollars out of balance.. 

Q: What was the main causes of imbalance in Texas' budget at the time of the claim?
A: State sales tax collections declined as a result of efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 through business closures, crowd limits and stay-at-home orders adopted in the state, as well as a precipitous drop in worldwide demand for oil,” Hegar said. “The steepest declines in tax remittances were from businesses most quickly and dramatically affected by social distancing: restaurants, performing arts venues, movie theaters, theme parks and fitness centers, as well as department stores and boutique retail shops. However, those losses were, to a degree, offset by increases from big-box retailers, grocery stores and online vendors. Remittances from oil- and gas-related sectors also fell significantly as oil and gas exploration and production companies slashed capital spending in response to the crash in oil price..

averitec_715,Fact Check: The UK Government put nurses' pay up in April 2020.,"Claim: The UK Government put nurses' pay up in April 2020.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The 3 year pay deal resulted in increases to nurses' pay in April 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Evidence:

Q: Did nurses in the UK get a pay rise in april 2020?
A: In 2018 the government and the NHS staff council agreed a three year pay deal which saw pay for nurses increase annually in April between 2018/19 and 2020/21..

averitec_716,Fact Check: In 2019 some nurses starting their career got a pay rise of over 15%,"Claim: In 2019 some nurses starting their career got a pay rise of over 15%

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Maximum possible was 12% and was in real terms less than this once inflation was taken into account

Evidence:

Q: How much do newly qualified nurses earn?
A: Salaries for most NHS staff are arranged into bands, and newly-qualified nurses start out in band 5 which starts at £24,907 in England. The more years of experience nurses accumulate, the higher their pay gets at band 5 level.

Between 2019/20 and 2020/21 nurses in band 5 would have seen their salary increase by between 3% and 12% through a combination of the amount you could earn at band 5 being increased, and their own progression through the band after gaining another year of experience.. 

Q: What is the upper limit of this progression?
A: The upper limit of this, 12%, is calculated based on a nurse with five to six years’ experience in 2019/20 and earning £27,260, moving up to a salary of £30,615 in 2020/21, the salary for nurses in Band 5 with six to seven years’ experience in that year.. 

Q: Did any lower paid nurses see a salary increase in 15% over a year?
A: No. no and the maximum 12% increase doesn't account for inflation. In real terms, the band 5 starting salary increased by 6.7% between 2017/18 and 2020/21. But since 2010/11, it has fallen by a total of 3.2%.

Evidence:

Q: Do Airline travelers to Florida have to fill out a form at the airport with contact information and trip details due to covid?

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Reports from indoor spaces (restaurants, offices) suggest that both physical proximity and duration of exposure are important for transmission

Evidence:

Q: Is walking past people in a shop setting, a high risk?
A: experts believe you’re less at risk than someone sitting still in a confined space. ""I would not worry about walking by someone,"" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told Slate. 

""Even in a health care setting, contact is defined by being near someone for a certain amount of time,"" Adalja said. ""I would not worry about these fleeting encounters. The virus isn’t airborne—droplets need to get from one person to another."". 

Q: How high risk is worship in indoor spaces?
A: ""Reports from indoor spaces (restaurants, offices) suggest that both physical proximity and duration of exposure are important for transmission,"" Rasmussen said in an email. ""So sitting still around others in close physical proximity is probably higher risk than incidentally passing by someone in a store, but the risks aren’t quantified because there are a lot of variables that can impact this.""

A recent NPR article categorized 14 different activities by their level of risk for infection. Worship services? ""High risk."" Going shopping? ""Risk varies."".

A: No. The daily published cases in England in each of 149 Upper Tier Local
Authority (UTLA) areas were converted to Average Daily Infection Rate (ADIR), an R
value—the number of further people infected by one infected person during their infectious phase with Rate of Change of Infection Rate (RCIR) also calculated. Stepwise
regression was carried out to see what local factors could be linked to differences in

averitec_722,Fact Check: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden proposes raising the age to be eligibl...,"Claim: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden proposes raising the age to be eligible for Social Security benefits to 75.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: As a Democrat President Biden follows suit in trying to protect social security by not increasing the retirement age as the others have done 

Evidence:

Q: At what age are people in the U.S. eligible for Social Security retirement benefits?
A: You can start receiving your retirement benefit as early as age 62, or as late as age 70.. 

Q: Is the eligibility age for Social Security benefits getting older?
A: Increase in Retirement Age

For persons born in 1938 or later, their Social Security benefit may be affected by a provision that raises the age at which full Social Security benefits are payable.
The age for collecting full Social Security retirement benefits will gradually increase from 65 to 67 over a 22-year period beginning in 2000 for those retiring at 62.
The earliest a person can start receiving reduced Social Security retirement benefits will remain age 62.. 

Q: Does the U.S. Democratic Party want to raise the age you receive your social security benefits?
A: Democrats do not believe that raising retirement age is a reasonable solution to the problem. They believe that the institution of social security is one that needs protecting, stating, “In 1935, Democrats and President Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security. In 1965, Democrats and President Lyndon Johnson created Medicare. Ever since, Democrats have continually fought to defend these cornerstones of the American Dream in the face of attempts to dismantle or undermine both.”.

To regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the right to
keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes. 
v. 

Q: Did Democratic California Sen. Dianne Feinstein have any concerns with an amendment proposed by  Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn to allow military veterans to be exempt from the ban?
A: The problem with expanding this is that, you know, with the advent of PTSD, which I think is a new phenomenon as a product of the Iraq War, it’s not clear how the seller or transferrer of a firearm covered by this bill would verify that an individual was a member, or a veteran, and that there was no impairment of that individual with respect to having a weapon like this...
...find a way that veterans who are incapacitated for one reason or another mentally, don’t have access to this kind of weapon. 

Q: What did Tom Mentzer, Feinstein’s spokesman, say  when asked about the authenticity of the quote?
A: Tom Mentzer, Feinstein’s spokesman, told The Associated Press that the quote was false..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Soros does appear to make comments about the Covid-19 pandemic being a crisis of his lifetime and mentions a revolutionary moment but I feel that is taken out of context, in the answers given he doesnt seem to mention anything about salivating and wanting to remake society in the aftermath but does state our current ways of life are endangered and we dont know what the shape of capitalism will be in after.

Evidence:

Q: What has George Soros said about Covid-19 pandemic?
A: Soros said in an interview that: ""This is the crisis of my lifetime. Even before the pandemic hit, I realized that we were in a revolutionary moment where what would be impossible or even inconceivable in normal times had become not only possible, but probably absolutely necessary. And then came COVID-19, which has totally disrupted people’s lives and required very different behavior. It is an unprecedented event that probably has never occurred in this combination. And it really endangers the survival of our civilization."". 

Q: What has George Soros said about the opportunities created by Covid-19 pandemic?
A: Soros did no mention opportunities in his interview but talked about the future of capitalism: ""We will not go back to where we were when the pandemic started. That is pretty certain. But that is the only thing that is certain. Everything else is up for grabs. I do not think anybody knows how capitalism will evolve."".

A: No. Though the United States has ramped up testing from 150,000 tests per day from a month ago to 300,000 per day recently, the current rate still remains far behind the five million daily target he (Donald Trump) himself set last month.

Q: How does COVID-19 testing in the U.S. compare to other countries?

A: Narayana Health said that it is not true. They commented on the KMA's posts and said that the audio isn't by Dr Shetty and has been wrongly attributed to him.. 

Q: Is Dr Devi Shetty an expert on coronavirus ?
A: However, one little fact that gets sidelined is that, being a cardiothoracic surgeon by training, he is unlikely to have expertise in public health, epidemiology, statistics, planning, management etc. Secondly, being the Chairman of a corporate chain of hospitals, he has a terribly strong conflict of interest..

Evidence:

Q: viral outbreaks that have spread internationally between 1950 and 2019 mostly originated in china
A: China a hotbed for pandemics historically. 

Q: Are there examples of viral outbreaks mentioned in the claim that did not start in China?
A: In February 1957, a new influenza A (H2N2) virus emerged in East Asia, triggering a pandemic (“Asian Flu”). This H2N2 virus was comprised of three different genes from an H2N2 virus that originated from an avian influenza A virus, including the H2 hemagglutinin and the N2 neuraminidase genes. It was first reported in Singapore in February 1957, Hong Kong in April 1957, and in coastal cities in the United States in summer 1957.

Q&A 3 shows no antifreeze is in a vaccine as claimed.
Q&A 6 shows that some animal dna may be present but not animal viruses, 
Q&A 7 shows formaldehyde is used in production but not final product, and no answer is given on if blood is included as claimed so some extra evidence is needed but also some cherry picking of details is happening in the claim so overall there is mostly cherry-picking in the claim.

Evidence:

Q: What are the ingredients in the 2020 flu shots in the US?
A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: Is mercury in the flu shot 2020?
A: Thimerosal is a preservative used in multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine to keep them free from contamination and contains an organic form of mercury called ethyl mercury.

Ethyl mercury is not the same as methyl mercury, which may be found in fish and shellfish. Methyl mercury stays in the body and can make people sick, while thimerosal doesn't stay in the body. There is no evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines.. 

Q: Is antifreeze in the flu shot 2020?
A: The vaccine does not contain squalene, which has been accused – also without good evidence – of causing Gulf War syndrome..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the 3rd question and answer it seems that thrombosis is not the leading cause of death.  Therefore the claim is refuted 

Evidence:

Q: What is Thrombosis?
A: Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel. The vessel may be any vein or artery as for example, in a deep vein thrombosis (venous) or a coronary artery (arterial). The clot itself is termed a thrombus.
Once formed, a clot can slow or block normal blood flow, and even break loose and travel to an organ. A clot that travels to the circulation is called an embolism. Thrombosis is the often preventable underlying pathology of heart attack, thromboembolic stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), the top three cardiovascular killers.. 

Q: Can Covid 19 cause a Thrombosis?
A: Yes. COVID-19 is a hypercoagulable state with an increased risk of thromboembolism in hospitalized individuals (typically venous but may be arterial).

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that there are no drugs approved as a treatment for coronavirus so the claim is clearly refuted.

Evidence:

Q: When was this claim made?
A: 05/05/2020. 

Q: Has the US FDA approved Remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19?
A: No. The United States FDA has made Veklury (remdesivir) available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA.
The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist
to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Veklury has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved or cleared product. FDA may issue an
EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, available alternatives.
In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is
reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be
effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. All of these criteria must be met to allow for
the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A: There are no medicines approved by the FDA as safe and
effective to treat people in the hospital who have COVID-19..

A: Breathing over and over exhaled air turns into carbon dioxide, which is why we feel dizzy..

A: Yes. A study did look at the various effects of wearing a mask and the corresponding stress on different physiological activities such as breathing,

Q: What did the study find from face masks and breathing difficulty?
A: the conclusion was that in general increased physical activity leads to more oxygen demand at our tissue level; hence, there could be a less efficient exchange of airflow. But the severity of this also differed from the wearing of face masks..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q3 finds that these comments were taken out of context. 

Evidence:

Q: Did N.Y Gov Andrew Cuomo praise president Donald trumps response to the covid 19 pandemic in the U.S?
A: Cuomo said;  'What the federal government did, what the states did, what the healthcare workers did, the way Americans responded and acted responsibly, it is better than any of the predictors. The President is right when he gets up there and says the models had many more people dying. President’s right. '. 

Q: Did California’s Gavin Newsom praise president Donald trumps response to the covid 19 pandemic in the U.S?
A: California’s Gavin Newsom said; yesterday I announced that the President was extending support for new swabs, to get more specimens to increase our testing capacity. We got word today that 100,000 swabs that he committed this week, 90,000 are arriving and we’ll start to distribute them in the next day or so. That’s very encouraging.. 

Q: Are these quotes taken out of context?
A: Yes. The Trump ad omits Cuomo’s reference to ""working with the states,"" but the essence of this statement in the ad is accurate. The ad portrays Cuomo as complimentary of Trump, even though the governor at times has been one of the most high-profile critics of the Trump administration’s pandemic response.

Before the pandemic, Newsom was a frequent Trump critic and in February called California the ""most un-Trump state in America."" During the pandemic, Newsom has praised Trump, and the president has returned the favor.

 In April, Cuomo said Trump was ""just wrong"" in claiming the power to tell states when to lift restrictions, and days later Cuomo mocked Trump and suggested he wasn’t doing enough to funnel funding and tests to the states.

A: Biden said that the pandemic was ""no time for Donald Trump's record of...hysterical xenophobia, and fear-mongering to lead the way instead of science"".. 

Q: Has Nancy Pelosi attacked Trump's pandemic response in 2020?

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Q&As show that there is no evidence for the quote being said so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What are the Fulani Herdsmen?
A: The Fula people, often described as the Fulani, are regarded as the world’s largest nomadic group: about 20 million people dispersed across Western Africa. They reside mostly in Nigeria, Mali, Guinea, Cameroon, Senegal, and Niger. They also can be found in Central African Republic and Egypt.. 

Q: What are the Fulani Herdsmen killings?
A: Fulani herds have gradually been pushed southward toward Nigeria’s “Middle Belt,” a handful of states straddling the pre-colonial line dividing Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north from its Christian south. The Middle Belt is a farming region, and the advancing Fulani-owned herds have increasingly encroached on croplands.

The resulting conflicts over land have taken on an ethnic and religious character, as many of the farmers of Nigeria’s Middle Belt are ethnic Berom, an indigenous people who are predominantly Christian.

Fulani herders have recently killed hundreds in Benue, Plateau, Adamawa and Enugu states, among others, with many of the suspected killers not arrested for prosecution, despite the repeated promises by the government, especially the police, to stop the nefarious activities of the killer herders and bring them to justice.. 

Q: What has Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osibanjo said about the Fulani Herdsmen killings?
A: Yemi Osinbajo had continually defended some inglorious policies of the Federal Government giving excuses for them. At a recent outing to the launch of a book to commemorate the 80th birthday of Olusegun Osoba, Osinbajo told the world that it is wrong for people to insinuate that the president is protecting herdsmen and Boko Haram groups.

Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks.

Justification: The answer shows that Ron did change his verdict

Evidence:

Q: What was Ron Johnson's position on this  in 2015?
A: ""It’s just incredibly important to have permanent inspectors general that are completely independent that will provide Congress and the American public transparency and that watchdog assignment — that responsibility for departments and agencies — so that we have awareness of what’s happening,"" Johnson said at a hearing on inspectors general that he chaired. ""It’s the only way we’re going to be able to improve the efficiency, the effectiveness, the accountability of government is to have that type of transparency."". 

Q: What was Ron Johnson's position on this  in 2020?
A: ""I think their independence needs to remain within their agencies,"" Johnson said. ""I’m very mindful of the fact that inspectors general don’t work for Congress.

averitec_799,Fact Check: Men are more likely to die than women from Covid-19.,"Claim: Men are more likely to die than women from Covid-19.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Both Q&A pairs point out that men do die from covid more than women as claimed, this pertains to global figures on the fatality rate for men and women due to covid so fully supports the claim

Evidence:

Q: Are men more likely to die than women from COVID-19?
A: There have been studies that have revealed that men are more likely to get more severe symptoms from COVID-19 disease and also more likely to die from complications of the disease. A new study corroborates these findings. The study titled, “Gender differences in patients with COVID-19: Focus on severity and mortality,” is published in the latest issue of the journal Frontiers in Public Health.

What did the study find?

The study reveals that both men and women are equally at risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, and men are more at risk of suffering the severe effects of COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and also more at risk of dying of the infection. Older men with underlying diseases are more at risk because of their age, as well as their gender, say the researchers. They wrote, “Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS.”. 

Q: Why are men more likely to die than women?
A: One major variable in severity of COVID-19 is age. But this can’t explain the sex bias seen globally because the increased male fatality rate is the same in each age group from 30 to 90+. Women also live on average six years longer than men, so there are more elderly women than men in the vulnerable population.

The other major factor is the presence of chronic diseases, particularly heart disease, diabetes and cancer. These are all more common in men than women, which might account for some of the bias..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Even if someone is healthy, it is recommended that they Wear Facemasks, says the CDC from the source. 

Evidence:

Q: What is the CDC recommendation on Covid 19
A: We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (""asymptomatic"") and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (""pre-symptomatic"") can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity--for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing--even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.. 

Q: Did the CDC advice on facemasks change over the course of the pandemic?
A: Yes. It was updated on April 3 2020 to recommend the use of facemasks

1. Don't expect additional discounts or sales.

Trader Joe's iconic newsletter, the Fearless Flyer, only comes out eight times a year. It highlights the newest products hitting shelves for that time of year, so customers can get a heads up on all the seasonal offerings. However, it's devoid of any coupons or discount offers—because the store already sells all of its products at the lowest possible price point.
2. Yes, coupons are accepted.

As mentioned, Trader Joe's does not offer any store coupons. But the chain does accept all manufacturer coupons, according to one personal finance blogger. It's worth a try to save a few extra bucks!.

averitec_815,Fact Check: Over 100 nurses in Rajasthan’s Jhalawar (India) resigned because of misconduct b...,"Claim: Over 100 nurses in Rajasthan’s Jhalawar (India) resigned because of misconduct by members of the Tablighi Jamaat (non-political organisation) and claim that they were spitting on them.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The third question-answer pair establishes that the reasons for the nurses resignation were to do with administration issues, low wages and lack of PPE. There is no mention of Tablighi Jamaat or spitting. Further questions to establish whether any reports from credible sources had mentioned spitting would have been helpful.

Evidence:

Q: What is Tablighi Jamaat ?
A: Tablighi Jamaat, which means 'the Society for Spreading Faith', is an Islamic missionary movement which aims to encourage Muslims to return to practising their religion during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and particularly in matters of ritual, dress, and personal behavior. The teachings of Tabligh Jamaat are expressed in ""Six Principles"" - Kalimah (Declaration of faith), Salah (Prayer), Ilm-o-zikr (Knowledge), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention), Dawat-o-Tableegh (Proselytizaton).. 

Q: Who founded The Tablighi ?
A: The Tablighi Jama’at was founded in 1926 in Mewat, India, by Maulana Muhammad Ilyas, an Islamic scholar and teacher. The movement began as an effort to counteract the activities of Hindu revivalists in India, who at the time were attempting to convert Muslims to Hinduism. Worried that existing Islamic educational institutions were not capable of fending off the Hindu challenge, Ilyas envisioned a movement that would send missionaries to villages to instill Muslims with core Islamic values.. 

Q: Why did the nurses resign from Jhalawar hospital?
A: the reports mentioned that the nurses had resigned due to administration issues and to rebel against low wages. The nurses also mentioned in their resignation letter that the healthcare workers weren't being given proper protection gear or PPE kits; they also mentioned how they were willing to come back to work if the conditions improved and if PPE kits were provided..

averitec_816,Fact Check: Australia's COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of a user.,"Claim: Australia's COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of a user.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence finds that Australia's COVIDsafe app does not track your location. Hence, the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Can COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of a user ?
A: The federal government has announced plans to introduce a contact tracing mobile app to help curb COVID-19’s spread in Australia. However, rather than collecting location data directly from mobile operators, the proposed TraceTogether app will use Bluetooth technology to sense whether users who have voluntarily opted-in have come within nine metres of one another.

Contact tracing apps generally store 14-21 days of interaction data between participating devices to help monitor the spread of a disease. The tracking is usually done by government agencies. This form of health surveillance could help the Australian government respond to the coronavirus crisis by proactively placing confirmed and suspected cases in quarantine.. 

Q: Does  COVIDsafe app use Bluetooth tracking  technology ?
A: In a scramble to track, and thereby stem the flow of, new cases of the Coronavirus, Governments around the world are rushing to track the locations of their populace. One way to do this is to write a smartphone app which uses Bluetooth technology, and encourage (or mandate) that individuals download and use the app. The aim of this piece is to provide more detail on the technology itself, rather than a deep dive into the risks and whether or not Bluetooth technology should be used.. 

Q: Can COVIDsafe app traces and monitors the location of the users ?
A: The COVIDsafe app doesn’t have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people’s phones that have downloaded the app and cannot monitor a person’s location at any time.Experts at the University of Sydney have also stated the app cannot track location..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is no evidence that Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy were assassinated for trying to end the Federal Reserve banking system.

Evidence:

Q: Was President Lincoln And Kennedy Assassinated  for trying  to End Federal Reserve banking system ?
A: There is a meme circulating on Facebook that seems to be based on the conspiracy theory that Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy were assassinated by the Rothschilds because they wanted to “end the federal reserve banking system.” Let’s pick this meme apart to see how historically accurate it is.

1. There was no federal reserve system when Lincoln was president. The Federal Reserve System was not established until 1913.

2. Prior to the Federal Reserve System, there had been a national bank*, and Andrew Jackson had made its end one of his key second-term goals.

3. Two assassins attempted to kill Jackson, but no evidence suggests that they were sent by the Bank.**

4. Some people have emphasized the eerie similarities between Lincoln and Kennedy, which are easily explainable.

* There were two national banks, in fact: The 1st Bank of the U.S., which was chartered from 1791-1811 and the 2nd Bank of the U.S., chartered from 1816-1836.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Lower numbers seem attributed to lesser testing.

Evidence:

Q: How many confirmed cases in Wisconsin during this time period?
A: Zooming in to the last six days (April 15 to 20), Wisconsin had between 147 and 170 new confirmed cases per day. The tally was lower the days before that due to a lower number of tests being performed.

The most recent tally released prior to the statement from Vos and Fitzgerald was April 20, with 153 cases, up six from the day before. That’s on par with the April average of 157 new cases per day.. 

Q: What about hospitalizations?
A: This is the lone metric that shows a decline over the last couple weeks.

After rising to start the month, the daily tally leveled off around 440 per day from April 9 to 14.

The number then dropped for two days before holding steady between 357 and 361 from April 17 to 21.. 

Q: Does this show a clear decline in COVID infections?
A: There are a lot of ways to slice the coronavirus data, but this is an exaggeration.

New cases and deaths in the week before this claim were roughly in line with both the preceding week and the averages for the month of April. Hospitalizations had dropped somewhat from the week prior, but were holding steady for the five preceding days..

averitec_848,Fact Check: Convalescent plasma therapy showing promise against COVID-19,"Claim: Convalescent plasma therapy showing promise against COVID-19

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Seems from the clinical data found in the questions to the answers, that this plasma therapy is indeed promising. Therefore, the claim is supported

Evidence:

Q: What is Convalescent plasma therapy?
A: Using convalescent plasma -- a component of blood -- as a treatment is a decades-old idea, and has been used to treat other diseases like influenza and measles. When a patient recovers from a disease, they produce antibodies to fight the presence of the antigen that caused the disease, and those proteins will remain in the blood for a few months.. 

Q: What proof is there that Convalescent plasma therapy is working for coronavirus patients?
A: Results  All 5 patients (age range, 36-65 years; 2 women) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of treatment and all had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the SOFA score decreased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days (range, 172-276 before and 284-366 after). Viral loads also decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2–specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased following the transfusion (range, 40-60 before and 80-320 on day 7). ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. Of the 5 patients, 3 have been discharged from the hospital (length of stay: 53, 51, and 55 days), and 2 are in stable condition at 37 days after transfusion.

Conclusions and Relevance  In this preliminary uncontrolled case series of 5 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and ARDS, administration of convalescent plasma containing neutralizing antibody was followed by improvement in their clinical status. The limited sample size and study design preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of this treatment, and these observations require evaluation in clinical trials..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: QA pair states black bamboo is an alternative medicine and in another states no evidence to support alternative medicines being helpful.

Evidence:

Q: Is black bamboo used in alternative medicine?
A: Yes. 2.1.2 Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro Commonly known as “black bamboo”, this is another major species in the genus Phyllostachys. Flavonoids extracted from black bamboo leaves have potent antioxidant activities (Hu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2002). Among these flavonoids, flavone c-glucosides and p-coumaric acid reportedly have long retention time in the colon and may contribute to free radical scavenging (Zhang et al., 2007). Luteolin 6-C-(6″-O-trans-caffeoylglucoside), an antioxidant isolated from the leaves, has been reported to protect against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity in retinal ganglion cells (Lee et al., 2010). It also enhances the activity of aldose reductase and inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end products, and therefore may potentially have a role in the prevention of diabetic complications (Jung et al., 2007).
Orientin, another antioxidant obtained from the leaves of black bamboo, exerts vaso-relaxant activity through the inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ influx (Fu et al., 2005). Orientin also prevents apoptosis induced by hypoxia and reoxygenation in myocardium and cardiomyocytes. The mechanism for this effect is inhibition of the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fu et al., 2006). These studies suggest potential for cardio-protective effects.

The acetone fraction of the leaves of Phyllostachys nigra (Lodd.) Munro has been shown to enhance leukemia cell differentiation (Kim et al., 2007b), and inhibit interleukin-12 (IL-12) production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages via decreasing NF-kappaB binding activity (Kim et al., 2007a). These preliminary findings suggest potential anti-leukemia and anti-inflammation effects of the acetone extract.

Q: Can alternative medicines be used to effectively treat Covid-19?
A: No. It's a myth

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: CDC estimates 28,000 deaths from influenza not 80,000.

Evidence:

Q: What was the mortality rate of the seasonal flu in 2018-2019 in the United States ?
A: 2018-2019 Estimates

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2018–2019 season began to increase in November and remained at high levels for several weeks during January–February5. Influenza A viruses were the predominant circulating viruses last year. While influenza A(H1N1pdm09) viruses predominated from October 2018 – mid February 2019, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were more commonly reported starting in late February 2019. Influenza B viruses were not commonly reported among circulating viruses during the 2018–2019 season. The season had moderate severity based on levels of outpatient influenza-like illness, hospitalizations rates, and proportions of pneumonia and influenza-associated deaths.

CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2018–2019 season included an estimated 35.5 million people getting sick with influenza, 16.5 million people going to a health care provider for their illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, and 34,200 deaths from influenza (Table 1). The number of influenza-associated illnesses that occurred last season was similar to the estimated number of influenza-associated illnesses during the 2012–2013 influenza season when an estimated 34 million people had symptomatic influenza illness6.

Peak activity during the 2018–2019 influenza season was classified as having moderate severity across ages in the population. Compared with the 2017–2018 season , which was classified as high severity, the overall rates and burden of influenza were much lower during the 2018–2019 season (Table 2). Among children, however, rates of influenza during the 2018–2019 season were similar to the 2017–2018 season.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Some vaccines were developed using MRC-5 cells but not all. 

Evidence:

Q: What is MRC-5?
A: Human Cell Strains.
Two main human cell strains have been used to develop currently available vaccines, in each case with the original fetal cells in question obtained in the 1960s. The WI-38 cell strain was developed in 1962 in the United States, and the MRC-5 cell strain (also started with fetal lung cells) was developed, using Hayflick's technology, in 1970 at the Medical Research Center in the United Kingdom.. 

Q: What vaccines has MRC-5 been used to develop?
A: The vaccines below were developed using either the WI-38 or the MRC-5 cell strains.

Hepatitis A vaccines [VAQTA/Merck, Havrix/GlaxoSmithKline, and part of Twinrix/GlaxoSmithKline]
Rubella vaccine [MERUVAX II/Merck, part of MMR II/Merck, and ProQuad/Merck]
Varicella (chickenpox) vaccine [Varivax/Merck, and part of ProQuad/Merck]

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Yes,fro  the 1st and 2nd QA it seems plausible that vaccines might cause an iatrogenic reaction. Therefore the claim is supported 

Evidence:

Q: Can vaccines cause an iatrogenic reaction?
A: Yes. Vaccines can cause a risk of side effects or complications.

Q: What is a Iatrogenic reaction?
A: Iatrogenic disease is the result of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken on a patient. With the multitude of drugs prescribed to a single patient adverse drug reactions are bound to occur. The Physician should take suitable steps to detect and manage them.

Iatrogenic (of a disease or symptoms) induced in a patient by the treatment or comments of a physician.

Chambers English Dictionary. 

Q: Are vaccines safe despite the risk of side effects or complications?
A: Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. 

Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease..

A: No. It refers to any enforced mandatory vaccination.

Currently, 15 states allow philosophical exemptions for children whose parents object to immunizations because of personal, moral or other beliefs. Many states align their vaccine requirements with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At this time, no state requires children to receive the COVID-19 vaccine for school entry.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Drinking alcohol actually increased health risks when one is infected with COVID and increases susceptibility to catching COVID and other illnesses

Evidence:

Q: What is the basis of this claim?
A: The claim asserts that because alcohol is used in hand sanitizer and cleaning products to kill the virus that causes COVID-19 on hands and surfaces, drinking it will have the same effect inside the body and sanitize the throat. This is definitely not the case. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that, while certain types of alcohol can be used to disinfect surfaces and your skin, they are poisonous when ingested. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers require an alcohol concentration of 60% to 80% by volume. 

Q: Will drinking alcohol disinfect your throat or kill COVID-19 in your body?
A: No. Drinking alcohol actually increased health risks when one is infected with COVID and increases susceptibility to catching COVID and other illnesses.

Mr. Trump: “Well, I have the ultimate authority.”.

A: No. “The President has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses,” Stephen I. Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said on Twitter. “No statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority.”

Q: What authority does he have?
A: While the federal government has authority over interstate and foreign quarantine measures, states have the primary authority to impose and enforce quarantine and isolation measures within their own borders, as part of the police powers conferred to states by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, according to the Congressional Research Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention..

A: In September of 2017 Theresa May began to show flexibility, allowing pay rises for police officers and prison workers. 

Then in March 2018 she lifted the cap on pay rises for NHS workers. 

This cap was eventually lifted was largely owing to pressure on Theresa May's government from worker's unions and the Labour Party who gained 30 seats in parliament less than a month before the vote in 2017.. 

Q: Did nurses receive a pay raise after the cap was lifted?
A: Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing agreed on a pay rise of 6.5 per cent over three years for nurses, paramedics, midwives and healthcare assistants.

This would take starting pay for nurses from around £22,000 in 2018 to £25,000 next year..

A: NEW YORK -- The World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have announced a collaboration to increase coordination across the international vaccine community and create a Global Vaccine Action Plan.  This plan will build on the successes of current work to achieve key milestones in the discovery, development and delivery of lifesaving vaccines to the most vulnerable populations in the poorest countries over the next decade.

The collaboration follows the January 2010 call by Bill and Melinda Gates for the next ten years to be the Decade of Vaccines.  The Global Vaccine Action Plan will enable greater coordination across all stakeholder groups – national governments, multilateral organizations, civil society, the private sector and philanthropic organizations -- and will identify critical policy, resource, and other gaps that must be addressed to realize the life-saving potential of vaccines. 

The structure of the Decade of Vaccines Collaboration includes a Leadership Council to provide oversight for the planning effort, a Steering Committee that holds the primary responsibility for developing the action plan, an International Advisory Committee to assist the Leadership Council in evaluating the action plan, and a Secretariat for administrative support. 

Prof. Pedro Alonso, Director for the Institute for Global Health of Barcelona and Dr. Christopher Elias, President and CEO of PATH, have been appointed co-chairs of the Steering Committee and the Secretariat. 

“Vaccines are miracles,” said Prof. Alonso, “For just a few dollars per child, vaccines prevent disease and disability for a lifetime. We must make sure that people understand that vaccines are one of the best investments in health.”

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There are no major health risks associated with exposure to 5G radiation

Evidence:

Q: Is 5G radiation harmful to human health?
A: the World Health Organization's International EMF Project, which investigates the health effects of electromagnetic fields on humans, argues there are ""no major public health risks [that] have emerged from several decades of EMF research."". 

Q: What are the potential health risks from 5G?
A: To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.

Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.

As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Q&A explains that the exosomes and covid virus are not the same and have different characteristics. So the claim is not correct. 

Evidence:

Q: What is an exosome
A: An exosome is an extracellular vesicle which is a particle with a lipid bilayer and cytoplasmic contents that cannot replicate like a cell and an exosome is an EV, usually a small one, that is released from an internal compartment of the cell”. 

Q: Are there differences in the microscopic images of both exosomes and the SARS-CoV-2
A: The exosomes is a sphere surrounded by a uniform membrane without the presence of spikes nor the shape of a crown but the coronavirus has “small peaks” (growths) formed by the protein “spike”, which gives it its characteristic crown shape.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the evidence below, Lighting a Diya or candle is not listed as one of the preventative measures for COVID-19. No evidence to suggest a Diya or candle can kill the Coronavirus.

Evidence:

Q: Can Lighting a Diya or candle kill Coronavirus?
A: Prevention Strategies in Alignment With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Behavior

Wear a Mask: When in public settings or when around people outside of your household, wear a properly-fitting cloth face covering. Wash your hands before putting on your face covering, put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin, and try to fit it snugly against the sides of your face. Make sure you can still breathe easily.

Hand washing: The most well-established way to prevent respiratory infections such as influenza and coronavirus is frequent and thorough hand washing with soap and water. Scrub your hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Hand sanitizer: Handwashing with soap and water is the best way to reduce germs, but if they are not available, alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol can help to reduce the spread of infection. Note: avoid any products containing triclosan, a known hormone-disrupting chemical.

Covering your mouth and nose: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing; if your hands are not free or you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your sleeve, not your bare hands.

Not touching your face: Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, which can help provide the virus with a route of entry into the body. Since the average individual touches their face an average of 15 times per hour, remain vigilant!

Keeping surfaces clean: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, especially when someone is ill. Surfaces to consider include doorknobs, phones, computer keyboards, remotes, and other surfaces that are frequently touched in rooms such as the bathroom and kitchen.
Lifestyle

Stress reduction: Chronic stress can negatively alter immune system responses, making you more likely to get sick. Identify your personal stress reduction strategies and practice them regularly.

Sleep: Sleep has a big influence on immune function, so it is es. 

Q: How does burning candles eliminate corona
A: COVID-19 can be transmitted by people with the virus coughing or sneezing, releasing tiny contaminated droplets into the air, putting anyone within range in danger of inhaling them. These droplets can travel more than a metre from the infected person, allowing them to settle on any surfaces ready to be transferred to anyone that touches the surface.

The virus can live on some surfaces for several days. Data from the 2003 SARS outbreak, which was a similar illness to the latest coronavirus, showed the virus could contaminate plastered walls for up to a day and a half, plastic and stainless steel for 72 hours, and glass for 96 hours. So it’s likely the mobile phone, tablet or computer screen you are reading this on could harbour COVID-19 for up to four days, and be transferred to anyone touching the screen.

Adopting good hygiene is one of the most effective weapons to slow or prevent the virus spreading. Here are six things you can do to protect yourself and others.


1. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth

Our hands touch door handles, keyboards, taps and numerous other surfaces, so the virus could easily be picked up this way. Rubbing tired eyes or touching your nose or mouth could transfer the virus from your hands into your body.

2. Wash your hands regularly

Clean your hands thoroughly and often, using plenty of soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub to kill any virus on your hands. Scrub for at least 20 seconds, making sure you clean fingers, thumbs and palms.



3. Practise respiratory hygiene


If you cough or sneeze, use a tissue and throw it in the trash afterwards. If you don’t have a tissue, cough into the crook of your arm instead of using your hand. If possible, avoid coughing or sneezing near other people.

4. Maintain social distancing

Be aware of people around you and keep your distance from anyone coughing or sneezing. Stay at least 1 metre away to prevent inhaling the small liquid droplets sprayed by coughs and sneezes..

averitec_963,"Fact Check: Alcohol weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight inf...","Claim: Alcohol weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight infections such as Covid-19.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: the answer show heavy alcohol consumption does affect the immune system, negatively. 

Evidence:

Q: Does Alcohol intake weakens the immune system ?
A: Too much alcohol dulls more than your wits. It also weakens your immune system and could make you much more vulnerable to viruses, including HIV.

To see how alcohol affects resistance to infection, Gyongyi Szabo of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and colleagues exposed monocytes – white blood cells involved in the front-line defence against infection – to chemicals that mimic viruses and bacteria. Half of the cells were also soused in the levels of alcohol that a person might have in their blood after quaffing four or five alcoholic drinks daily for a week.

Alcohol blunted the monocytes’ defences. When the over-the-limit cells were exposed to a virus mimic, they produced only a quarter as much of the virus-fighting signalling molecule called type-1 interferon as teetotal monocytes made.

“Interferon is pivotal, the first response to any viral infection,” says Szabo. “There’s no viral elimination without it.”. 

Q: What is the effect of Alcohol  on the immune system ?
A: Weakening the immune system is one of many negative effects heavy alcohol consumption has on the body. The mechanism is not fully understood and other factors such as age, gender, diet, state of general health may play a part.

Some studies have shown that, in moderation, certain alcoholic beverages such as wine and beer can actually decrease inflammation in the body. But at the same time, other studies suggest that even moderate consumption can do damage.. 

Q: How does Alcohol impact the Immune System ?
A: Advanced knowledge into the complex multi-layered interactions of alcohol on the immune system has been exposed in a wide range of research papers over the past decade, concluding that excessive alcohol consumption and misuse can have serious long-term deleterious effects on the immune system. Additionally, a mother who exposes her developing fetus to alcohol puts the baby at risk for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and an impaired immune system that is more susceptible to disease. An adult who drinks to excess puts themselves at risk of contracting pneumonia, as well as a greater likelihood of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and slower recovery from infection, wound healing and trauma..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: QA pairs do state that there was an increase in interest however many did not follow up with interview offers.

It also states Romania workers have the experience required to work the roles while any British counterparts are trained up.

Evidence:

Q: Are romanian workers  being brought in to do seasonal British farm work?
A: Yes. In mid-april 2020 it was  confirmed that a number of flights would be privately chartered to bring in experienced farmworkers from Romania.

Q: Was there huge interest from British people, in these jobs?
A: job site Totaljobs reported at the start of April that there had been an 83% increase in applications for agricultural roles in the past month. 

Q: Was there still a shortage of workers despite this?
A: The Country Land and Business association estimates that 80,000 agricultural workers will be needed by the industry this season. Others report a shortage closer to 90,000, although it is unclear where this figure comes from.

The Guardian reported in mid-April that 450 Romanian workers were expected to be brought in to help by one charter airline. This would still leave the vast majority of roles needing to be filled. 

The same article quotes Concordia, a Brighton-based charity that recruits volunteers, as saying that despite high interest in paid roles, of the 35,000 applicants, only 5,500 had taken up interview offers..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: If you are around someone with COVID-19 or in high-risk environments - then people coughing around you or your clothes touching contaminated surfaces - there is a risk of COVID-19 being spread to your shoes and being able to transmit the virus. 

Evidence:

Q: How is COVID-19 primarily spread?
A: The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.. 

Q: Can clothing, like shoes, transmit COVID-19?
A: No. Unless someone is coughing on you, or your clothing is in contact with a high-contact surface, it’s not so likely that the virus would remain on your clothes

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A 1 states that  coronavirus disease can not penetrate food which is in line with what the claim says, 
Q&A 2 says no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. 

Evidence:

Q: What was the official advice at the time of the claim in Hong Kong related to COVID-19 when preparing fruit and vegatables?
A: Centre for Food Safety, Hong Kong stated in March 2020 - Social platforms continue to spew lies that 2019 coronavirus disease can penetrate food spread.
FYI: There are currently no reports of coronavirus infection in humans with food. - The Food Safety Center reminds citizens: Keep your hands clean, especially before and after food, as before and after food.. 

Q: What detailed food saftey information was available at the time of the claim from official sources?
A: The CFC stated - Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food, it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging. You should always handle and prepare food safely, including keeping raw meat separate from other foods, refrigerating perishable foods, and cooking meat to the right temperature to kill harmful germs. See CDC’s Food Safety site for more information..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: This couldn't have been true because the major mode of transmission isn't what  was posited in the claim

Evidence:

Q: How is COVID-19 transmitted between humans?
A: According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and
contact routes.1-6

Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact (within 1 m) with someone who has respiratory
symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing,) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae (mouth and nose) or
conjunctiva (eyes) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets (which are generally considered to
be > 5-10 μm in diameter). Droplet transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment
around the infected person.7
 Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with
infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used on the
infected person (e.g. stethoscope or thermometer). 

Q: What is the main source of transmission for COVID-19?
A: The latest guidelines from Chinese health authorities [23, 43] described three main transmission routes for the COVID-19: 1) droplets transmission, 2) contact transmission, and 3) aerosol transmission..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Even though the Nigella Sativa seeds have some properties that can limit the action of the virus in the body, further studies needs to be done to arrive at a conclusion 

Evidence:

Q: What anti-covid properties does Nigella Sativa have?
A: COVID-19 pandemic has become a serious public
health concern with high transmission rate affecting
millions of lives worldwide. NS is a potential antiviral
therapy for combating COVID-19 infection. Molecular
docking studies have indicated that nigellidine and
α-hederin are major compounds in NS which have
capability to constrain COVID-19 infection. NS extract has
potential to increase IL-8 levels and alter the expression of
TRP genes during coronavirus infection. NS seed extracts
also has potential to block cytokine storm and oxidative
stress produced during COVID-19 infection. These
encouraging and supportive results provided an approach
to further perform in vitro and in vivo research.. 

Q: Does there need to be more clinical trial of Nigella Sativa, before conclusions can be drawn?
A: Future clinical trials conducted using TQ will unravel how exactly we can use it in the current COVID-19 pandemic state..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The WHO never said that autopsies should not be conducted. 

Evidence:

Q: Did Italy disagree with WHO autopsies  instruction on COVID-19 casualties.
A: Apart from suspect, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 cases, autopsies might be requested for patients not suspected to be SARS-Cov2 positive. Due to the high level of contagion in hospitals and in the general population, any corpse is regarded as potential source of infection. Therefore, for any autopsy, we recommend always to adopt the same biosafety measures as for confirmed COVID-19 cases. In addition, in cases of autopsies without apparent SARS-CoV-2 infection, we recommend (i) to discuss with the clinicians the reason why the post-mortem examination is requested; (ii) and if available, to perform nasal-oropharyngeal swabs on corpses within 2 h of death to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection to implement the safety measures [3].. 

Q: Did the  WHO release guidelines to countries about preforming no autopsies  for COVID-19 casualties?
A: No. The guidelines did not say that autopsies should not be conducted.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A 1 shows that there is no evidence of the Dr named in the claim said this, and then points out the FDA claims that drinking tea is amongst fraudulent claims about cures for Covid which is what the claim says drinking tea will cure.

Evidence:

Q: Who is Dr Li Wenliang?
A: Li Wenliang (李文亮), MD, was an ophthalmologist in Wuhan, China, who warned several of his colleagues about the appearance of a new SARS-like virus in December 2019, at the very beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic.. 

Q: Is there any evidence that Dr Li Wenliang suggested that drinking tea can cure COVID-19 patients?
A: No. This false claim - shared on social media - refers to the Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, who was hailed a hero for his efforts to raise the alarm about the virus early on in Wuhan, and who later died of the disease.

It claims that in his case files, the doctor had documented evidence that substances commonly found in tea - known as methylxanthines - can decrease the impact of the virus.

The widely shared post also falsely claimed that hospitals in China were giving Covid-19 patients tea three times a day. It's true that methylxanthines are found in tea, as well as in coffee and chocolate.

But there's no evidence Dr Li Wenliang was researching their effect - he was an eye specialist, rather than an expert on viruses - nor that hospitals in China were treating Covid-19 by giving patients tea.

Q: Can Covid-19 be cured by drinking tea as claimed by China's Dr Li Wenliang ?
A: It is a fake news.
We checked out the CNN website, but could not find any such news. We searched their Twitter handle for breaking news, but no such thing was reported.
We found a report about China's whistleblower doctor on CNN but that article too does not talk about the medication he suggested nor does it talk about the utility of the chemical compounds of tea as claimed by social media users.
Here's CNN Breaking News's Twitter handle.
On Google search too, we found no reports that support the claim. Also, there are no reports that doctors in China are serving tea to Covid-19 patients.
We found a news report by China Daily related to this topic.
According to this report, researchers from the Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention found through experiments that because of its chemical components, drinking tea could help prevent novel coronavirus infections.
But later the article was removed by the Zhejiang CDC on February 26, China Daily reported.
On checking FDA website it is found that tea is among the fraudelent product to cure Covid-19.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: COVID-19 can spread via airborne transmission, this means it can be airborne although it only stays in the air for 3 hours Under experimental conditions, and about 30 minutes in most real-world situations before settling onto surfaces.

Evidence:

Q: Is Corona virus an ""airbourne"" Virus?
A: Yes, When an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, droplets or tiny particles called aerosols carry the virus into the air from their nose or mouth. Anyone who is within 6 feet of that person can breathe it into their lungs. Airborne transmission. Research shows that the virus can live in the air for up to 3 hours.. 

Q: How long does corona virus last in the air?
A: Upto 3 hours.. 

Q: Can Corona virus be caught in any other ways than being airbourne?
A: Yes it can be caught by touching infected surfaces.

SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Figure 1A), although the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel). The stability kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 were similar (from 103.4 to 100.7 TCID50 per milliliter after 72 hours on plastic and from 103.6 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel). On copper, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 4 hours and no viable SARS-CoV-1 was measured after 8 hours. On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 24 hours and no viable SARS-CoV-1 was measured after 8 hours (Figure 1A)..

A: SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close communities.

When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus. These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Q&As show that at the time the claim was posted the ventilators were not being made so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Did Ford and General Motors manufacture ventilators during the COVID-10 pandemic?
A: Yes. General Motors and Ventec Life Systems announced that the car company would begin retooling its manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, to make “critical care ventilators” that could be ready to “ship as soon as next month.”

Q: Did this happen before Trump made his claim it was happening ""right now""?
A: No. It wasn’t until nearly a week after the president’s claim that General Motors and Ventec Life Systems announced that the car company would begin retooling its manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, to make “critical care ventilators” that could be ready to “ship as soon as next month.”

Prior to that, GM had been working to produce or procure parts for Ventec to increase Ventec’s output of ventilators, and GM was only “exploring the feasibility to build ventilators” at one of its own facilities, a company spokesman told us.

The CEO of Ford, meanwhile, has said recently that it could be May or June before Ford, which is partnering with another company that makes the lifesaving machines, begins to produce them in mass.

Q: Were alternative statements made around the time of the claim to - American automakers, including Ford and General Motors, manufacturing much needed medical ventilators ""right now""?
A: Yes. Days after the claim was Tweeted Forbes reported Mar 23, 2020, - Though President Trump insisted this weekend that American automakers were already producing ventilators without his having to compel them using the Defense Production Act, the AP reported Monday that Ford, General Motors and Tesla are months away from being able to convert their factories into medical supply production facilities. On Sunday, the president tweeted: “Ford, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST! @fema Go for it auto execs, lets see how good you are?” 

Forbes further clarified - Neither Ford nor General Motors is making ventilators right now, and while Tesla’s Elon Musk has said his company is “working on it,” there’s no evidence to suggest that production is underway, and it could take months to get there, according to the AP report.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: At the date of the claim, chloroquine was still being researched as to its efficacy to treat COVID-19.

Evidence:

Q: Has chloroquine been approved for use in treating Covid-19?
A: No. The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.

Q: Has a timeline been established as to when this drug may be available for use treating Covid-19?
A: FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, speaking after the president, said the FDA is considering giving chloroquine to larger populations of coronavirus patients as part of an “expanded use” testing program. Such a trial in patients would allow the FDA to collect data to measure scientifically whether it works. It was not immediately clear how long it would take the FDA to design the study and get it working at trial sites around the country..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence denies the mortality rates and the similarities between the flu and Covid-19.

Evidence:

Q: Is covid19 the same as the common cold?
A: NO:
COVID-19 is novel, or new. That means there's no vaccine, and it's unclear how it will manifest;
This strain of coronavirus appears to infect two to 2.5 people versus 1.3 with the flu, so coronavirus seems to be about twice as contagious as the flu;
Some 20% of coronavirus patients are in serious enough condition to go to the hospital, 10 times the number who wind up in the hospital because of the flu;
Hospital stays for the coronavirus are twice as long as for the flu;
About 8% of people get the flu every year. Some estimates are 25% to 50%, possibly up to 80%, could get the coronavirus without drastic actions being taken by individuals, states and municipalities and the federal government;
The coronavirus could be 10 times deadlier than the flu — about 0.1% who get flu die. It's estimated that about 1% of those who have gotten coronavirus have died from it;
There are treatments for the flu. There are no approved treatments for the coronavirus, despite the president's optimism for certain drugs, which are untested for coronavirus to this point; and
The flu tends to wane in warm weather, but it's too soon to count on that for coronavirus, which is thriving in warm, tropical places.. 

Q: Was the US Mortality rate for covid19 0.1% at time of the claim?

A: the President may exercise
emergency authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA; 50 U.S.C. §§4501 et seq.) to

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The method of estimating in this case was faulty, ad evidenced. The second answer does not seem to answer the second question. 

Evidence:

Q: Is the COVID-19 fatality rate in 2020 overstated by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus ?
A: The fatality rate of the coronavirus was based on current data available of known positive cases and known deaths.
Oftentimes estimates have to be made because data is just not yet available. The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, used the fatality rate of coronavirus with known numbers and used this as his prediction of eventual mortality rate.  This was a faulty assumption.  Estimates usually involve obtaining information that is available and making estimates on what is not. We cannot tell the future but we can make educated guesses based on information available. This is what has been done with the coronavirus because this type of virus has apparently never been seen before.

2. Sometimes estimates are reasonable and sometimes they are wrong, and even way off.
Advertisement - story continues below

The point is that whenever estimates are made of large unknown values they are always wrong because no one can tell the future. Sometimes estimates end up close and sometimes they are not and sometimes they are way off.

3. The current “estimate” for the coronavirus fatality rate according to the WHO is about 3.4%.
The estimate used most often is from the WHO based on the Director General’s comments.  The WHO estimates the mortality rate of the coronavirus to be around 3.4%:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the mortality rate from Covid-19 is about 3.4%. That is higher than seasonal flu and is cause for concern – but even if it is correct, more than 96% of people who become infected with the coronavirus will recover.

Advertisement - story continues below

4. The same rate for this year’s seasonal flu is 10% if you use known cases and known deaths (but the media tells you it’s .1%).
As The Gateway Pundit reported earlier, according to CDC numbers, in the US in the 2019-2020 flu season, there were 222,552 confirmed cases of the flu from testing and an estimated 36 million flu cases in the United States.

The History of Pandemics

Pan·dem·ic /panˈdemik/ (of a disease) prevalent over a whole country or the world.

As humans have spread across the world, so have infectious diseases. Even in this modern era, outbreaks are nearly constant, though not every outbreak reaches pandemic level as COVID-19 has.

Today’s visualization outlines some of history’s most deadly pandemics, from the Antonine Plague to the current COVID-19 event.
A Timeline of Historical Pandemics

Disease and illnesses have plagued humanity since the earliest days, our mortal flaw. However, it was not until the marked shift to agrarian communities that the scale and spread of these diseases increased dramatically.

Widespread trade created new opportunities for human and animal interactions that sped up such epidemics. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, smallpox, and others first appeared during these early years.

The more civilized humans became – with larger cities, more exotic trade routes, and increased contact with different populations of people, animals, and ecosystems – the more likely pandemics would occur.

Here are some of the major pandemics that have occurred over time:
Name	Time period	Type / Pre-human host	Death toll
Antonine Plague	165-180	Believed to be either smallpox or measles	5M
Japanese smallpox epidemic	735-737	Variola major virus	1M
Plague of Justinian	541-542	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	30-50M
Black Death	1347-1351	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	200M
New World Smallpox Outbreak	1520 – onwards	Variola major virus	56M
Great Plague of London	1665	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	100,000
Italian plague	1629-1631	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	1M
Cholera Pandemics 1-6	1817-1923	V. cholerae bacteria	1M+
Third Plague	1885	Yersinia pestis bacteria / Rats, fleas	12M (.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The QA Pair states they are going to trial it and not that it has been successful already.

Evidence:

Q: Did China  close down coronavirus hospital as there were not enough new cases ?
A: Correct. On 10 March 2020, the last two of 16 makeshift hospitals that had been set up in Wuhan to combat the new coronavirus outbreak were closed, according to local news sources and international media. On 18 March 2020, no new Covid-19 cases were reported in the province of Hubei (of which Wuhan is the capital) for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. Very few cases have been officially reported in Hubei since this date and travel restrictions have begun to be relaxed in the area.. 

Q: Were the doctors in India had been successful in treating coronavirus with a combination of drugs  ?
A: India’s ministry of health has recommended using some of these drugs, but it is not clear how successful they have been so far. 

Guidance for the clinical management of Covid-19 mentions using the anti-HIV drugs Lopinavir and Retonovir to treat certain patients who are in high-risk groups.It is unclear how successful this treatment has been. It has been reported that Indian doctors cured Italian patients with this treatment, but this is not confirmed by official sources. 
The World Health Organisation is including Lopinavir and Ritonavir in trials looking for ways to treat Covid-19.This claim is partially correct.. 

Q: Did the researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center have found an antibody against coronavirus ?
A: This is true. Researchers from several institutes, including the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, have published a paper (which hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed) that reports on a neutralising antibody for the new coronavirus. Neutralising antibodies are produced by the immune system to protect against viral infection, and are what vaccines aim to induce in the human body..

All US citizens are entitled to $700 per week to stay at home to avoid the spread of COVID-19 novel coronavirus, starting from March 17 2020.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: this isn't true, and following the claim link clearly shows it to be a joke. 

Evidence:

Q: Are US citizens entitled to a stay-at-home allowance?
A: As part of a stimulus package aimed at relieving the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration wants to send cash to Americans. That means you could get a check for $1,000 or more in the coming weeks, an idea that has drawn bipartisan support since Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called for every American adult to get a check for that amount ""immediately.""

But as Congress hammers out the details, there’s no discussion of weekly $700 checks, as a recent Facebook post claims.. 

Q: Where did the claim appear?
A: Facebook.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Questions & answers writted well descriptively.

Evidence:

Q: What is the assessment of health experts regarding the capability of the US healthcare system to handle the number of people who could be infected with the coronavirus?
A: The coronavirus pandemic could soon force American physicians to face a tragic challenge — rationing medical care as the number of ill patients overwhelms the supplies, space and staff available in hospitals.

Today, the United States has fewer than 800,000 hospital beds, about 68,000 adult intensive care unit beds of any kind, and, even with the strategic reserve, fewer than 100,000 ventilators. As the coronavirus spreads, this will not be enough.

If even 5 percent of the 325 million people living in America get Covid-19, the current data suggests that 20 percent of them — 3.2 million people — will require hospitalization and 6 percent — 960,000 people — will require beds in intensive care units for many days. Covid-19 patients will simply overwhelm our health care system.. 

Q: Was there a lack of medical personnel in the US at the time the claim was made in March 2020?
A: There are currently shortages of healthcare workers of all kinds. Emergency departments are overcrowded and often have to divert patients to other hospitals.
During an epidemic, the healthcare workforce would be greatly reduced. Healthcare workers would face a high risk of infection because of contact with infected patients; many would need to stay home to care for sick relatives, and, in the absence of vaccine, others might fear coming to work lest they bring a lethal infection home to their families..

averitec_1107,Fact Check: COVID-19 came to the United States in 2019.,"Claim: COVID-19 came to the United States in 2019.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: This claim is refuted. According to the QA pairs, the first known COVID-19 case in the US was on January 15th 2020. Therefore, this claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: When was the first  confirmed COVID-19 case in the United States ?
A: On Jan. 15 2020, when the traveler to Wuhan who became the first known U.S. case returned to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, he took group transportation from the airport with other passengers, county officials have said. At the time, 41 people in Wuhan had been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, so named for the crownlike spikes that help them invade cells, and Chinese officials said the threat of human-to-human transmission was low. A CDC notice advised Americans who’d been in Wuhan and felt sick to seek care.

On Jan. 17, the U.S. began checks of passengers from Wuhan at airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Two days later, the recent arrival from Wuhan visited the urgent-care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, and the intensive response began. In retrospect, it was already too late. Some researchers who’ve traced the viral genomes of patients around the world now believe someone else in the area picked it up between Jan. 15 and Jan. 19, before the traveler went to the hospital. He might have sneezed in the airport shuttle or on some surface—all but impossible for health workers to trace.

“This virus is more contagious than the flu, so any sort of exposures before he got to the hospital would be certainly of high concern,” said George Diaz, who leads the infectious disease department at Providence, where the patient was treated.. 

Q: Who was the first first COVID-19 patient in the United States ?
A: The man who would become Patient Zero for the new coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. appeared to do everything right. He arrived Jan. 19 at an urgent-care clinic in a suburb north of Seattle with a slightly elevated temperature and a cough he’d developed soon after returning four days earlier from a visit with family in Wuhan, China. The 35-year-old had seen a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention alert about the virus and decided to get checked. He put on a mask in the waiting room. After learning about his travel, the clinic drew blood and took nasal and throat swabs, and called state and county health officials, who hustled the sample onto an overnight flight to the CDC lab in Atlanta. The patient was told to stay in isolation at home, and health officials checked on him the next morning.. 

Q: Where was the origin of the first COVID-19 virus case in the United States ?
A: After a US patient contracted novel coronavirus and left medical authorities no clues as to where it came from, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers, the top CDC official said Thursday.
A patient in California who has cornonavirus didn't travel anywhere known to have the virus, the CDC announced Wednesday night. And the patient wasn't exposed to anyone known to be infected.
The patient is in serious condition, Rep. John Garamendi, who represents the district in California where the patient is from, told CNN's ""OutFront with Erin Burnett..

Q: Is there a vaccine for tuberculosis?
A: BCG, or bacille Calmette-Guerin, is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. Many foreign-born persons have been BCG-vaccinated. BCG is used in many countries with a high prevalence of TB to prevent childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary disease. However, BCG is not generally recommended for use in the United States because of the low risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the variable effectiveness of the vaccine against adult pulmonary TB, and the vaccine’s potential interference with tuberculin skin test reactivity. The BCG vaccine should be considered only for very select persons who meet specific criteria and in consultation with a TB expert..

Q: What does the World Health Organisation say about the creation of a coronavirus vaccine?
A: Many potential vaccines for COVID-19 are being studied, and several large clinical trials may report results later this year. If a vaccine is proven safe and effective, it must be approved by national regulators, manufactured, and distributed..

averitec_1145,Fact Check: COLLOIDAL SILVER KILLS CORONAVIRUS,"Claim: COLLOIDAL SILVER KILLS CORONAVIRUS

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The FDA source shows that there is no evidence that colloidal silver is effective in the treatment of coronavirus. 

Evidence:

Q: What is Colloidal Silver?
A: Colloidal silver is a solution that consists of very small silver particles suspended in a liquid. A “colloid” is a liquid that evenly distributes certain particles within it.

Some people take colloidal silver by mouth as a dietary supplement. Many internet-based sources claim that colloidal silver has a range of health benefits.

However, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims, and ingesting silver may have mild to severe health consequences.. 

Q: What has the FDA said about Colloidal Silver?
A: In the Federal Register of October 15,
1996 (61 FR 53685), FDA published a
proposed rule to declare that all OTC
drug products containing colloidal
silver ingredients or silver salts are not
generally recognized as safe and
effective, and are new drugs and
misbranded within the meaning of
section 201(p) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21
U.S.C. 321(p)). Colloidal silver is a
suspension of silver particles in a
colloidal base. In recent years, colloidal
silver preparations of unknown
formulation have been appearing in
retail outlets. These products are labeled
for numerous disease conditions, many
of which are serious diseases. The
dosage form of these colloidal silver
products is usually oral, but product
labeling also contains directions for
topical and, occasionally, intravenous
use.
FDA has not approved a new drug
application (NDA) for any colloidal
silver product. None of the silver salts
evaluated as part of FDA’s OTC drug
review was found to be generally
recognized as safe and effective for its

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Sanders has addressed the claim saying he is not.

Evidence:

Q: Has Bernie Sanders ever addressed the claims that he is a communist?
A: Yes. ""obviously, I am not a communist""
""The difference between my socialism and Trump's socialism is, I believe the government should help working families, not billionaires. So I believe that health care is a human right. I believe we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. I believe, in fact, that the rich must start paying their fair share of taxes when you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.""

Q: What is communism?
A: political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society. Communism is thus a form of socialism—a higher and more advanced form, according to its advocates. Exactly how communism differs from socialism has long been a matter of debate, but the distinction rests largely on the communists’ adherence to the revolutionary socialism of Karl Marx.. 

Q: What is socialism?
A: social and economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources. According to the socialist view, individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The answers and sources show there are many different health care plans but they do not have any evidence to say they are cheaper so the claim can not be supported or refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Does the US have health care plans other than Obamacare?
A: Yes. In the Affordable Care Act marketplace

Q: Are these alternative health care plans governed?
A: Yes. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) [1] added title XXVII to the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), part 7 to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and Chapter 100 to the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), providing portability and nondiscrimination rules with respect to health coverage. These provisions of the PHS Act, ERISA, and the Code were later augmented by other laws, including the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996,[2] the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008,[3] the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act,[4] the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act,[5] the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008,[6] the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009,[7] Michelle's Law,[8] and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA).[9]

Q: Are these alternative health care plans cheaper than Obamacare?
A: Estimating the actuarial value of such products is challenging because the scope of coverage is so varied and
because coverage generally completely excludes services
for any preexisting condition.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that this isn't true

Evidence:

Q: Did Obama's administration make calls to the North Korean President, Kim Jong Un
A: Several Obama administration officials promptly and vehemently contradicted Trump’s account.

“At the risk of stating the obvious, this is horse-sh*t,” tweeted Susan Rice, who served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 2009 to 2013 and as Obama’s national security adviser from 2013 to 2017.

“Yes. It’s horseshit,” added Gen. Michael Hayden, via Twitter. Hayden served as director of the CIA from 2006 to Feb. 12, 2009, shortly after Obama took office.

Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, added his voice on Twitter as well: “Trump is lying. I was there for all 8 years. Obama never sought a meeting with Kim Jong Un. Foreign policy isn’t reality television it’s reality.”

Rhodes told CNN that Obama “never even considered” seeking a meeting with Kim. “There’s no mystery here: It’s just a lie with no supporting evidence and no basis in anything. It’s not even an exaggeration, it’s just not true.”

And on CNN’s “State of the Union,” James Clapper, who served as director of national intelligence for most of Obama’s presidency, said he was puzzled by Trump’s claim. “In all the deliberations that I have participated in on North Korea during the Obama administration, I can recall no instance whatever where President Obama ever indicated any interest whatsoever in meeting with the — Chairman Kim,” Clapper said.

We reached out to the Trump press office, but it did not provide any further information.

It’s true that during a debate in the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, Obama famously said that he would be willing to meet with leaders in North Korea and other enemy nations without any preconditions..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: This claim does not have enough evidence. The QA pair only answers what supposed board Hunter Biden was part of. Corruption allegations in the claim are not examined further in the QA pairs. Therefore, there is not enough evidence for the claim.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that Hunter Biden did not have that amount of money, it was a proposed amount so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What fund did Hunter Biden create with Jonathan Li and Devon Archer in 2013?
A: In 2012, Archer and Hunter talked to Jonathan Li, who ran a Chinese private-equity fund, Bohai Capital, about becoming partners in a new company that would invest Chinese capital—and, potentially, capital from other countries—in companies outside China. In June, 2013, Li, Archer, and other business partners signed a memorandum of understanding to create the fund, which they named BHR Partners.. 

Q: Did Hunter Biden have an equity stake in BHR Partners whilst his father Vice-President Joe Biden was in office?
A: No. Hunter became an unpaid member of BHR’s board but did not take an equity stake in BHR Partners until after his father left the White House.

Q: Did Hunter Biden obtain $1.5 billion after a successful deal with Bank of China for his fund BHR Partners?
A: No. According to a Wall Street Journal article on July 10th 2014, it was reported that BHR Partners were ""aiming to raise about $1.5 billion to invest abroad"". This was only an aim for the fund, not a confirmed number.

Justification: Children have had covid-19.

A: Yes. There has been confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children. The 'A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster' focuses on two asymptomatic children (patients 5 and 6).

We see relatively few cases among children. More research is needed to understand why""-@DrTedros #COVID19. 

Q: Do children get milder symptoms of COVID-19 than adults?
A: Compared to infected adults, the condition of infected children is significantly milder, with faster recovery, shorter virus shedding time and better prognosis. By far, only 2 critical cases have been reported, of which one was a child of 7 months old with congenital heart disease. The other patient was 13 months old with bilateral hydronephrosis and calculus of left kidney. Both cases progressed rapidly to respiratory failure after onset, requiring support of invasive mechanical ventilation. It demonstrates that children with underlying diseases are tended to progress to severe and critical cases, so we should pay high attention to such group and strengthen supervision for them..

A: In some areas the number and set up machines caused delays. Every county was different.

The county assigned 1,767 machines to the Republican primary and 1,015 to Democrats, with input from the county parties.

does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents that were published in 2014.. 

Q: What was one of the causes of the high death rate in the US during COVID
A: The CDC developed its own test for the virus rather than employing a German-developed one used by the World Health Organization. But the CDC test was flawed, causing a deadly delay while scientists worked out the problem. The agency was not designed to produce tests at the scale needed to spot the infections as they silently spread through the population. Meanwhile the Food and Drug Administration was slow to approve tests made by private companies, says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.. 

Q: Did Obama administration made a decision on testing and that turned out to be very detrimental ?
A: No, there was no Obama rule, simply “guidance"" that was never acted on because Congress stepped in and decided it would craft the necessary legislation. So Trump's blaming Obama adminstration for its failure to quickly expand testing for coronavirus across the United States is incorrect..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Q&A make it clear there was no charge for Covid tests at the time of the claim.

Evidence:

Q: When was this claim made?
A: 03/03/2020. 

Q: How much does it cost to get a COVID-19 test in the US as of March 3, 2020?
A: The coronavirus test itself shouldn’t generate a bill – for now – since the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is picking up the tab. That could change as more labs start running the test.

But the visit and other tests aren’t free. How much you’ll owe depends on several factors, including what insurance you have, where you seek treatment and what tests providers give you. For instance, those who haven’t satisfied their deductibles will likely be on the hook for more of the bill. Going to the emergency room is typically far more pricey than visiting your doctor or an urgent care clinic.. 

Q: How much does it cost to get tested for COVID-19 in the US without health insurance?
A: Trump administration is looking at providing hospitals with funding to care for the uninsured..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence finds this to be incorrect. The economy would not shrink under a Canada-style deal.

The government’s analysis said that ""in all scenarios, the economy would be expected to grow,""  albeit slower than if we had not left the EU.

The 4.9% is estimated from a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) that would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% of GDP growth after 15 years.

Evidence:

Q: What is expected to happen to the UK economy if they stay in the EU
A: According to the Economic impacts of Boris Johnson's Brexit Proposal, staying in the EU will affect the economy but not shrink the economy. 

Q: Why is it thought the UK Economy would shrink 4.9% under a Canada-style deal with the EU.
A: This seems to refer to government analysis which estimated that a hypothetical free-trade agreement (FTA) with the EU where we maintained tariff-free access but there were still non-tariff costs (such as regulatory barriers) would cost the UK between 4.9% and 6.7% of GDP growth after 15 years.

Justification: The Q&A pair show that they are behind because of their own testing kits so the claim is supported.

Evidence:

Q: What caused the United States to lag behind other countries in the detection of the novel coronavirus
A: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lost valuable weeks that could have been used to track its possible spread in the United States because it insisted upon devising its own test. 

Q: Did the United States had a fewer diagnostic of people for coronavirus than other countries ?
A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: What contributed to the United States’ relatively low screening numbers ?
A: An error with the CDC’s early test kits.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The sources show that there were tests and some people were tested but not many and so the claim is refuted.

A: Secretary of Health and Human services Azar said on March 1st - We're ramping up testing. You know, we now have 75,000 tests available out there in the United States. And over the next week that will expand radically on top of 75,000 tests available.. 

Q: Was there any other comments from the US government?
A: Anthony Fauci - FAUCI: The fact is, the tests are out there. There was a misstep early on with regard to the tests, namely a technical difficulty. But right now, about 1.1 million tests are out there now. They'll be an additional about 640,000 on let's say Monday.

averitec_1200,Fact Check: the Canadian government will welcome three million immigrants in 2020.,"Claim: the Canadian government will welcome three million immigrants in 2020.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems 3 million immigrants will be welcome over 3 years time, therefore the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: How many new immigrants has Canada welcomed in 2020 ?
A: Canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years, according to the multi-year strategy tabled by the Liberal government today in what it calls ""the most ambitious immigration levels in recent history. The number of economic migrants, family reunifications and refugees will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 this year. That number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020. The targets for economic migrants, refugees and family members was tabled in the House of Commons Wednesday afternoon. Hussen said the new targets will bring Canada's immigration to nearly one per cent of the population by 2020, which will help offset an aging demographic. He called it a historic and responsible plan and ""the most ambitious"" in recent history. ""Our government believes that newcomers play a vital role in our society,"" Hussen said. ""Five million Canadians are set to retire by 2035 and we have fewer people working to support seniors and retirees."". 

Q: Does the Canadian government had plan of welcome three million immigrants in 2020 ?
A: November 1, 2017 – Ottawa plans to welcome 980,000 new immigrants over the next three years under an ambitious three-year immigration plan announced by the federal government on Nov. 1. Annual immigration levels could rise to as high as 360,000 by 2020 under the multi-year plan. This would be first time in more than a century that our immigration rate is 1% of our population.

Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen described the announcement as ‘historic’, as the government outlines its plan for the next three years, featuring managed increases across all categories.

In 2018, the immigration target will rise to 310,000, from the current 300,000 set for 2017. This target could rise to as much as 330,000 under the latest announcement. In 2019, the target will be 330,000, with an upper limit of 350,000 new immigrants. In 2020, the target figure will be 340,000, and the upper limit 360,000.

The latest plan will drive up immigration numbers to historic levels as the government pushes the annual number of newcomers towards 1 per cent of Canada’s population a target first used by the Liberals in the early 1990’s. The current levels of 300,000 correspond into an immigration rate near .82 per cent..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The sources and answers below show that some of the claim is supported but the claim about women getting cancer has been misconstrued so the claim has conflicting evidence.

Evidence:

Q: Has Bernie Sanders said women get cancer due to orgasms?
A: No. In a 1969 essay, Bernie Sanders made the claim that a woman's inability to achieve an orgasm is what causes cervical cancer.

Q: Has Bernie Sanders written on women’s fantasies of rape?
A: Yes. Bernie Sanders wrote a 1972 essay in which he wrote – among other things – that a woman ""fantasizes being raped by three men simultaneously.""

Q: Has the Bernie Sanders campaign commented on his 1972 essay, which includes women's fantasies of rape?
A: Yes. Michael Briggs, Sanders’ newly minted campaign spokesman, said the article was a “dumb attempt at dark satire in an alternative publication” that “in no way reflects his views or record on women.”

A: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up her copy of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech and told reporters that tearing up the address was “the courteous thing to do considering the alternatives.”. 

Q: Did the Congress file charges against Nancy Pelosi
A: No. First of all, Pelosi didn’t break the law when she tore up a copy of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Feb. 4. Trump, among others, wrongly claimed it was illegal. 

And while some people have signed a Change.org petition calling for her arrest after she ripped up her copy of the president’s speech, no arrest has happened.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: A pay of £25,600 does not equates to an unskilled  worker level of pay. All workers must earn the same minimum wage. 

Evidence:

Q: What is considered an unskilled worker in the U.K?
A: Unskilled work involves simple tasks and doesn't usually require one to exercise judgment. It typically requires only a month or less to learn. Many, but not all, unskilled jobs require physical strength or coordination..

A: The U.K government accepted The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) recommendation on salary thresholds, including to lower the general salary threshold from £30,000 to £25,600.. 

Q: Does only a skilled worker need to be paid a minimum under the governments immigration rules?
A: No. All workers must earn the same minimum, However, if they earn less than the required minimum salary threshold, but no less than £20,480, they may still be able to come if they can demonstrate that they have a job offer in a specific shortage occupation,

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The reduction Bloomberg touted is based on a comparison of data from the beginning of 2012 and the end of 2013, the end of his time in office. 

Evidence:

Q: When was Bloomberg mayor of NYC?
A: He was the 108th Mayor of New York City for three terms from 2002 to 2013. 

Q: What are the stop-and frisk stats for 2002-2013?
A: The NYPD stopped and interrogated people 684,330 times in 2011, by far the highest total since the Police Department began collecting data on its troubling stop-and-frisk program in 2002. This represents a 603 percent increase in stop-and-frisks since that year, the first year of the Bloomberg administration, when there were only 97,296 stops.. 

Q: Was the stop-and-frisk policy challenged?
A: Yes. In 2012 the NYCLU sued the NYPD over stop-and-frisk abuse at private residential buildings, and in January 2013 a federal court found widespread constitutional violations. In August 2013 the court found similar violations in a much broader case brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging street stops generally.

Justification: Q1 is unanswerable - before what? I don't think the answer should include ""no"". He may have chosen not to include it in his memoirs, for example.  The source is dated Feb 2020 but was updated in Jan 2021.
However, the evidence at Q&A2 indicates the claim may be false. The evidence could have been expanded upon, especially at Q&A1 where a couple more answers could have been given.


Evidence:

Q: Had Biden ever mentioned being arrested trying to see Nelson Mandela before?
A: No it is not featured in his memoirs.. 

Q: Has anyone spoke of the alleged arrest?
A: Andrew Young, a former congressman and mayor of Atlanta who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, said that he had traveled with Mr. Biden over the years, including to South Africa. But Mr. Young said that he had never been arrested in South Africa and expressed skepticism that members of Congress would have faced arrest there..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: As of February, around $1 million a day is being distributed to bushfire victims 

Evidence:

Q: At the time of the claim, how much had the Australian Red Cross distributed to victims of bushfires?

It has already issued 690 grants, totalling $6.9m so far.. 

Q: What was the data for February?
A: These grants more than double existing immediate financial assistance, with the Red Cross Bushfire Advisory Panel allocating a further $30.5 million, with a new total of $61.5 million now available for immediate cash relief.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: QAs show WHO’s policy is that a child’s presence can be considered informed consent if the parent has not opted out having been notified of the imminent vaccination via ‘social mobilisation and communication’ i.e. presence is not automatically deemed to be informed consent.

Evidence:

Q: What is the WHOs policy on vaccination for children under the age of 16
A: A 2014 WHO report outlines three commonly used consent processes for vaccination programs: written, verbal and implied.. 

Q: According to the WHO, is a child appearing in school tantamount to giving consent for vaccination
A: Some laws and regulations are
in place that identify school- or social-services
officials as appointed guardians for children
and adolescents not living with their parents,
including adolescents in boarding school. This is
also called “third party consent”. In such cases,
these third parties can provide consent for
medical care, including vaccination of specific,
individual children.. 

Q: How does informed consent work, would parents be contacted in various ways before the consent is implied?
A: An implied consent process by which
parents are informed of imminent vaccination
through social mobilization and communication,
sometimes including letters directly addressed to
the parents..

Q: Did Trump cut this pay rise?
A: Yes. Trump wrote in a Feb. 10 letter to Congress. “We must maintain efforts to put our nation on a fiscally sustainable course; federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases.  Accordingly, I have determined that it is appropriate to exercise my authority to set alternative pay adjustments for 2021.”

A: 1% - “Our pay system must reform to align with mission-critical recruitment and retention goals, and to reward employees whose performance provides value for the American people,” Trump wrote. “For this purpose, my budget further directs agencies to increase awards spending in FY 2021 by an amount equal to no less than 1% of total salary spending.

Q: Does Tony Evers plan on reducing prison population
A: State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers said Wisconsin needs to follow the example of states like Texas that have cut parole revocations and expanded drug courts. He said he would consider releasing some inmates early; providing more drug treatment behind bars; treating 17-year-olds as juveniles instead of adults for criminal charges; and overhauling truth-in-sentencing so prisoners could be released for good behavior.

“The fact that we as a state spend more on corrections than (the University of Wisconsin) System tells me the last thing we need is to build a brand-new prison,” he said in an emailed statement..

Another 5,000 were meant to be trained in 2016/17, when phase 2 started. But the available data shows that only 3,854 people were trained. 

Phase 3 was “put on hold” due to the department’s “funding challenges”. A commitment to more funding was reportedly made in January 2020..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The evidence is not clear on whether Amy Klobuchar intends to resettle ""500"" percent more refugees, although she will direct the State Department to restore the cap to at least its pre-Trump Administration level. It is also not clear what the cap was before Trump. Evidence also does not clarify where the refugees will be placed, though states and counties are required to notify the state department, in writing, whether they will consent to receive refugees from the department's reception and placement program. Hence, it feels like some information is still missing.

Evidence:

Q: Did US Senator Amy Klobuchar vow to resettle 500 percent more refugees
A: Senator Klobuchar will direct the State Department to restore the cap to at least its pre-Trump Administration level. 

Q: Do all U.S states allow resettlement of refugees?

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The claim is refuted, according to the QA pairs the labor force actually rose by 5.06 million during Obamas Presidency which is a statistic taken from the Labor department.

Evidence:

Q: Is the claim of Trump correct that 300,000 people left jobs in 8 yrs and 3.5 billion joined under his govt. ?
A: Trump is being misleading with numbers to tarnish his predecessor’s record. It’s not clear what he means by “working-age.” But the total size of the U.S. labor force shows that the president is just wrong.During the eight years of Obama’s presidency, the labor force rose by 5.06 million, according to the Labor Department. The improvement reflected a rebounding economy from the Great Recession and population growth.

As the unemployment rate has fallen, more people are finding it attractive to work and joining the labor force. This has enabled the labor force to climb by an impressive 4.86 million in just three years under Trump..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answer and credible source show that the WHO do not call the covid virus a plague so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What is plague?
A: Key facts
Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas.
People infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days.
There are two main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.
From 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths.
Currently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.
Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through:
the bite of infected vector fleas
unprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials
the inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague.. 

Q: What is coronavirus?
A: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.. 

Q: What was the declaration made by WHO on 30/01/2020?
A: The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus a global health emergency, an acknowledgement of the risk the virus poses to countries beyond its origin in China and of the need for a more coordinated international response to the outbreak..

averitec_1298,Fact Check: The Delhi Police in India is being slammed for their apparent inaction when a ma...,"Claim: The Delhi Police in India is being slammed for their apparent inaction when a man was shot at Jamia Millia Islamia University

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence shows that the Delhi Police did apprehend the man after they were made aware that he was carrying a weapon. Video evidence shows that at the 14th second, it can be seen that the police sneak up behind him and catch hold of him. Hence, the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Did the police react to the shooting ?
A: Standard protocols dealing with an active shooter were followed. Several videos have surfaced which shows the Delhi Police did apprehend the man after they were made aware that he was carrying a weapon. While analyzing the video, at the 14th second, it can be seen that the police sneak up behind him and catches hold of him. The Police are being warned that the man is carrying a pistol. The video clearly shows that the man was seized as soon as he fired a shot. Further, police are mandated to follow standard protocols when dealing with an active shooter. In the face of a man holding a weapon at a crowded place like a university, it becomes all the more necessary to follow these protocols precisely. This would ensure that the situation doesn't get out of hand, and the shooter does not get agitated. Police officers responding to an active shooter are trained in a procedure known as Rapid Deployment and are supposed to proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. The first responding officers will normally be in teams of four (4); they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might also be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. There's nothing safe about a single officer running to confront a potential murderer or a terrorist.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that is is 40 to 50 billion so the claim is refuted as it states 50 billion every year.

Evidence:

Q: Would the new Trump-trade agreement between US and  China boost American agriculture by $50 billion every year?
A: If U.S. ag exports to China do reach $40 billion in the future, that would be a 54% increase, and $50 billion would be 93% — not “two and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point.”

That is still a substantial increase, but not nearly as high as Trump said, and we don’t know if U.S. agricultural exports to China will ever get that high.. 

Q: What does the China-US trade deal mean for US agriculture?
A: Mnuchin told Fox News Channel that the deal reached on Dec. 13 still calls for China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products annually and a total of $200 billion of U.S. goods over two years.

“It wasn’t changed in translation. I don’t know where that rumor started,” Mnuchin said on the “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo” show.

“We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was really a technical issue,” Mnuchin said. “And the language will be released this week. So I think it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version.”.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answer and credible source show that coronavirus is not a hoax and so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: How real is COVID-19
A: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow)..

averitec_1318,"Fact Check: Comedian, Samuel Whitcomb Hyde is behind the spread of Coronavirus.","Claim: Comedian, Samuel Whitcomb Hyde is behind the spread of Coronavirus.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is no evidence at all that Hyde has anything to do with Covid, and the Q&As show the most likely causes of Covid spread.

Evidence:

Q: How did the spread of covid-19 likely occur?
A: In late December, the World Health Organization learned that several patients in Wuhan, China had contracted pneumonia from a virus that did not match any known viruses. In early January, officials in China concluded that the virus was a new coronavirus, a group of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, known as MERS.. 

Q: Where did Coronavirus originate?
A: Bats are natural reservoirs of coronaviruses, and likely harbor many other coronaviruses not yet discovered. However, while direct spillover of a new virus from bats to humans is possible, zoonoses often stem from exposure to intermediate animal hosts. Research conducted in China and elsewhere since the COVID-19 pandemic began has shown that a range of animals – including wild and farmed species – are susceptible to infection, but when and where SARS-CoV-2 spilled over to humans, and from which animal, remains unknown.. 

Q: Where was the first COVID outbreak detected?
A: Where an epidemic is first detected does not necessarily reflect where it started. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was identified through surveillance in Wuhan, however the possibility that the virus may have silently circulated elsewhere cannot be ruled out. For example, some countries have retrospectively identified cases of COVID-19 weeks before the first case was officially notified through surveillance, and unpublished reports of positive sewage samples could suggest that the virus may have circulated undetected for some time. The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported in Wuhan, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus was also first identified and characterized. The detection was followed by a rapid exponentially growing outbreak, weeks before other outbreaks were detected elsewhere. Thus, under the framework of global tracing for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the approach to identifying the source of infection, the source of introduction and possible origins of the virus initially conducted in Wuhan is of importance for further global origin tracing work..

Justification: No evidence to show that the CCP will say this, and they would be unlikely to if it is true.

Evidence:

Q: What does the CDC about the origin of the 2019 coronavirus?
A: Officials are still working to determine the source of the coronavirus outbreak. In its most recent situation summary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that both it and Chinese authorities had isolated the genome of the 2019 coronavirus.

Their findings suggest ""a likely single, recent emergence from a virus related to bat coronaviruses and the SARS coronavirus."" The disease appears to have originated at a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, and it spread from there to several Asian countries, Australia, France, Canada and the United States. Researchers believe the current outbreak pattern suggests the coronavirus may have spread from animal to human at first, and now from human to human..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The third source shows that the solution can not protect against coronavirus so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What is Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS)?
A: MMS consists of chlorine dioxide, a powerful bleach that is used both on textiles and in the industrial treatment of water.. 

Q: Is Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) an approved medical treatment?
A: MMS has been banned in several countries around the world for use as a medical treatment.
In the US, the chemical cannot be sold for human consumption. In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put out a public warning after it was notified of many injuries to consumers from drinking the fluid, with symptoms that included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe dehydration and one person who had a life-threatening reaction.. 

Q: Have authorities taken any action to stop Miracle Mineral Solution being promoted as a cure for COVID-19?
A: Miracle Mineral Solution is perhaps the most prominent but not the only product targeted by the FDA in what it has dubbed Operation Quack Hack.  Since March, the FDA has issued 42 warning letters demanding that firms stop making false claims about preventing or treating Covid-19. 

“We are actively monitoring for any firms marketing products with fraudulent COVID-19 prevention and treatment claims,” the agency said, noting that it has discovered “hundreds of such products including fraudulent drugs, testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) sold online with unproven claims.”.

Justification: The sources and answers below show that the 2 scenarios are different and so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Did Trump hold up aid money to Ukraine?
A: The Trump administration is slow-walking $250 million in military assistance to Ukraine, annoying lawmakers and advocates who argue the funding is critical to keeping Russia at bay.. 

Q: Why did the Obama government put a hold on Egypt aid?
A: The decision to suspend these weapons came reluctantly, several months after the Egyptian military’s July 3, 2013, ouster of President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.  Fearing a rupture with the military that would jeopardize US security interests, the US administration did not take any punitive action immediately after Morsi’s overthrow.  Instead it adopted a cautious, wait-and-see approach, hoping, along with many Egyptians, that the coup would set the country quickly on a more democratic path..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The source shows that the tax burden is at its lowest in 50 years so the claim is supported.

Evidence:

Q: Why did the average Wisconsin resident tax burden fall
A: Our annual review of state and local taxes shows that the state’s tax burden – defined as the total of those taxes as a share of state residents’ income – dropped once again in 2019. This extends a long-running trend that is attributed both to limited growth in taxes and relatively strong growth in income..

averitec_1332,Fact Check: Presidential candidate Joe Biden fought for decades to cut social security in th...,"Claim: Presidential candidate Joe Biden fought for decades to cut social security in the US.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Well written

Evidence:

Q: Did Joe Biden called for cut social security in the US?
A: Biden had an ambivalent relationship with government spending. Considered in the 1980s to be one of the Democratic Party’s new ​“neoliberals,” Biden called then for a spending freeze on Social Security and a higher Social Security retirement age. In 1995, he cast his vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment, despite his earlier criticisms of it. The choice was, he said, ​“an imperfect amendment or continued spending.” When he ran for president 12 years later, he again called for the Social Security retirement age to go up.

In journalist Bob Woodward’s 2012 book The Price of Politics, he portrays Biden during Obama’s first term eager to sacrifice Social Security and Medicare for the sake of bipartisan compromise and achieving what would be, in the eyes of Washington, a political victory.

Biden first displayed his friendliness to GOP entitlement hawks when he appointed former Wyoming Sen. Alan Simpson to co-chair the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility, created in February 2010 via executive order. Simpson was one of Congress’s most high-profile foes of entitlements and a proponent of Social Security privatization. In Woodward’s telling, Biden even had to lightly pressure a somewhat reluctant Simpson to take the role.

Sure enough, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, as it came to be known, recommended cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, leading liberal economist Paul Krugman to label the commission ​“terrible.” Failing to secure enough votes from the commission to recommend the plan to Congress, the proposals were never taken up.

But Biden took a far more direct role in undermining Social Security and Medicare when he headed tax policy negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in December 2010. In Woodward’s telling, Biden’s eagerness to cut a deal with the Republicans sometimes elicited outrage from his fellow Democrats, who felt he was giving too much away.

An Obama priority was to end the Bush tax cuts on t. 

Q: How long was Joe Biden kept proposing cuts to Social Security in th US ?
A: Biden has been proposing cuts to Social Security and Medicare for decades on exactly these grounds. In 1984 he proposed freezing Social Security benefits — that is, ending cost-of-living adjustments that boost benefits to keep up with inflation. In January 1995 he gave a speech endorsing a balanced budget amendment (an utterly lunatic policy) and boasted about his previous record of proposing ""that we freeze every single solitary program in the government, anything the government had to do with, every single solitary one, that we not spend a penny more, not even accounting for inflation, than we spent the year before."" In November 1995 he did so again, boasting that ""I tried with Senator Grassley back in the '80s to freeze all government spending, including Social Security, including everything."".

Justification: The source shows that Biden does not back cuts to social security so the claim is refuted.

A: Records indicate that fringe was first used on the flag as early as 1835. It was not until 1895 that it was officially added to the national flag for all regiments of the Army. For civilian use, fringe is not required as an integral part of the flag, nor can its use be said to constitute an unauthorized addition to the design prescribed by statute. It is considered that fringe is used as an honorable enrichment only. (Military tradition)

Q: What are 'crisis actors'?
A: A crisis actor (aka actor-patient or actor victim) is a trained actor, role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during emergency drills to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMS personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises. 

Conspiracy theories and defamation - In the United States, the term has been used by conspiracy theorists who claim that mass shootings and other disasters are staged, and victims and their families are being played by crisis actors in order to pass gun control laws. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist James Tracy suggested that the government could have hired an acting agency named Visionbox to help stage the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Visionbox offered dramatic training ""in criminal and victim behavior"" to actors intended to help ""bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places""..

These measures include background checks on all gun sales, a restriction of sales’ frequency, and allowing localities to ban firearms at public events..

Justification: this is mostly true, the wages today have the same buying more as 30 years ago.

Q: Was the US rep Mark Pocan's tweet on the difference in wages correct
A: From a narrow perspective, Pocan is off — an offer of $12.75 does not equate to hourly wages from 30 years ago, as a straight comparison or with inflation factored in.

The Milwaukee Police Department's policy on foreign nationals echoes the mayor's position. It says, ""Police members shall not inform federal immigration officials of whereabouts or behavior of any suspect illegal immigrant"" unless that person has been arrested for a serious criminal offense.

On Wednesday, Milwaukee County supervisors debated an anti-discrimination resolution that would prohibit ICE and Homeland agents from targeting undocumented immigrants inside the courthouse..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The 1st and 2nd Q&A pairs do attempt to give figures for the claim , however these are many years before the claim date and so are not accurate, this is explained in Q&A pair 3 which state the reason for outdated and unavailable data is  the statistics bureau is chronically underfunded, and so more up to date evidence is required for the claim.

Of about 300 employees nationwide, only a few have the analytical computer skills needed to analyze numbers in the context of modern Information Technology systems..

averitec_1371,Fact Check: Images show wombats taking animals into their burrows in a bid to protect them f...,"Claim: Images show wombats taking animals into their burrows in a bid to protect them from bushfires in Australia

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Although evidence suggests that other animals use burrows, it is suggested that the animals go into the burrows of their own accord. Wombats definitely do not shepherd other animals into their burrows. However, wombats are generally tolerant of other animals. Hence, the claim is misleading.

Evidence:

Q: Do wombats share their burrows with other animals?
A: Yes. In a research article titled “Interspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows”, which was published in the scientific journal Australian Mammalogy in 2016, scientists said, in part:

“Burrow use was monitored using 34 motion-activated cameras placed outside wombat burrows between March and September 2015. Eleven species were found to use burrows, with six commensal species observed using burrows on numerous occasions. These included two mammal species (black-footed rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis pearsoni; brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata), three reptile species (peninsula dragon, Ctenophorus fionni; southern sand-skink, Liopholis multiscutata; White’s skink, Liopholis whitii), and one avian species (little penguin, Eudyptula minor). 

“The most common species observed using burrows was the black-footed rock-wallaby, which was recorded using burrows 1795 times.”

Q: Are these animals invited in or taken in by wombats?
A: No. Wombats definitely do not shepherd other animals into their burrows. It is possible that this idea arose because someone saw an animal either follow a wombat into its burrow, or the other animals went in first followed by the wombats.

“Wombats generally are fairly tolerant of other animals. This may be because they have few real predators so they don't feel threatened by most animals, especially those that are small enough to fit in their burrows. They do interact with other animals on occasion.”  Although unintentional, the refuge wombats provide for other animals has proved crucial in protecting them against raging bushfires. 

The “Interspecies co-use of southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) burrows” research paper states in part: “Burrows can provide refuge for both burrowing and non-burrowing species within harsh environments through protection from climatic extremes, water loss and predation.”

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems that 5hevcharges were not reinstated, therefore the claim is refuted 

Evidence:

Q: what was Jessie Smollett charged for
A: The “Empire” actor first claimed that early in the morning on Jan. 29, 2019, two men came up to him in the bitter cold on Lower North Water Street as he was heading to his apartment. He said they yelled racial and homophobic slurs at him, told him “this is MAGA country,” poured a chemical on him and put a rope around his neck.

But as police investigated the case, they began saying that indicators pointed to Smollett orchestrating the attack. Police concluded that Smollett paid two brothers – Abel and Ola Osundairo – to stage the attack, because he was upset with his salary on his Fox show.

Smollett was indicted on 16 counts of disorderly conduct in March,. 

Q: how was the case resolved
A: the office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx dismissed the case without a plea, after Smollett agreed to surrender his $10,000 bail and perform 16 hours of community service.. 

Q: were the charges against Jessie Smollett reinstated
A: Webb took on the case for free after a judge appointed him to investigate the circumstances that led the state’s attorney’s office to drop the initial charges against Smollett.

Though Webb found no evidence of criminal misconduct by Foxx and her staff in the office’s decision to drop the charges, he accused the county’s top prosecutor of “substantial abuses of discretion.”

Webb’s full report on his finding remains under seal and has not been released to the public..

Justification: From the Q&As it seems that this claim is not correct and certain aspects were a mistake on an article. The claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: What conclusion was reached by the West Atlantic Ice Sheet study concerning its melting
A: This study found that the ice sheet retreated about 10,000 years ago before then stabilizing and expanding. The researchers used a model to investigate why it stabilized and applied this knowledge to discuss how the ice sheet will behave as it continues to retreat today.. 

Q: What is causing the melting of the West Atlantic ice Sheet
A: Recent studies have identified significant ongoing ice loss from West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) in response to recent climate and ocean changes. 

Q: Is volcanic activity  the dominant cause of West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) melting?
A: The PlateClimatology.com article mistakenly lists the title of a press release about the study as the title of the study. The study does not claim that this volcanic heat flow is the cause of modern ice loss measured there. It explains that “the existence of subglacial volcanism impacts both the stable and unstable dynamics of an ice sheet such as the [West Antarctic Ice Sheet]”..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: It does look like the biodiesel plant in Crawfordsville, Iowa, had to close due to waivers made by Trump and that the administration's actions have unfairly benefited the oil industry.

Evidence:

Q: Why did a biodiesel plant in Iowa close?
A: According to the president of the biodiesel plant: ""The administration’s actions unfairly benefit the oil industry at the expense of our local farmers and if not addressed soon, will impact the livelihoods of many."". 

Q: Did the biodiesel plant in Crawfordsville, Iowa, close partly due to the trade war but mostly due to the waivers?
A: W2 Fuel, a southeast Iowa biodiesel plant, has shut down in response to the unclear future for the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS). The Crawfordsville, Iowa plant produced 10 million gallons of biodiesel annually. The shutdown will put 50 people out of work, according to the Des Moines Register. In addition to the Iowa plant’s shutdown, the owners will also close the doors of a plant in Michigan.ould tread water for a little while, but I came to a point where I was underwater. I couldn’t make a profit at all. I was bleeding cash,” said Roy Strom, CEO of W2 Fuel to reporters at the Des Moines Register.

This is the third plant in Iowa alone to announce it will shut down following small refinery exemptions (SRE) to RFS. Similar announcements have been made in other states.

Earlier this month, Siouxland Energy Cooperative in Sioux Center, Iowa announced it would idle production over SREs.

“The administration’s actions unfairly benefit the oil industry at the expense of our local farmers and if not addressed soon, will impact the livelihoods of many,” said Kevin Neiuwenhuis, president of the board for the plant in a recent press release.

In early August the Trump administration granted 31 additional SRE waivers. Six additional waiver requests were either withdrawn or denied.

“The vast majority of these exemptions are not justified under the law,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw in a press release. “Since this news began to leak this afternoon, RFS credit prices have freefallen to nearly zero, destroying much of the incentive to blend an incremental gallon of ethanol.”.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The second answer and source shows that you have to have a licence to drive a vehicle in the US so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Is driving without a license illegal in the USA?
A: Penalties for Driving Without a License
Failure to produce a valid driver's license when asked by a police officer can lead to a number of penalties depending on the circumstances. Charges typically fall into one of two categories: correctable offenses and willful violations.

Correctable Offenses

Simply forgetting to carry your driver's license while driving a vehicle may lead to a ""fix-it ticket,"" where you must later show proof that you fixed the violation in order to have the citation dismissed by the traffic court. Failure to present this evidence typically leads to fines or other penalties.

Willful Violations

Penalties for willful violations of licensing requirements, such as driving on a suspended or revoked license, are much more serious. Driver's licenses are frequently suspended for DUI offenses, since states have an interest in keeping dangerous drivers off the roads. Therefore, when a driver willfully drives with a suspended or revoked driver's license, they may be cited, arrested, and charged with a misdemeanor offense.. 

Q: Did the U.S. Supreme Court rule that Americans do not need a licence to drive automobiles on public roads?
A: No. No record exists of this.

A: Greenhouse gases are gases that allow sunlight to pass through, but absorb infrared radiation (heat) emitted by the Earth back toward space.

In greenhouse gases, those wavelengths are mainly found in the infrared portion of the spectrum, rather than the visible or ultraviolet..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The third Q&A shows that Trump did not threaten to destroy Iran so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Did Trump Threatened to destroy Iran?
A: The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy.  It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos.  The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are, in fact, its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors.  This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.  Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don’t think you’ve heard the last of it — believe me.. 

Q: When did Trump Threatened to destroy Iran ?
A: Trump has responded to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s comments suggesting that the White House is “mentally disabled,” and Trump is “afflicted by a mental disorder.” Rouhani questioned Trump’s mental faculties in response to new sanctions imposed on Iranian officials by Trump. “The White House actions show it is mentally retarded,” said Rouhani, calling them “outrageous and idiotic.” He also accused the US of lying about wanting to resume talks between the two countries. “You say you really want to hold talks with us, but at the same time you’re saying that you want to boycott and sanction our foreign minister, so you’re lying,” he said. The comments seemed to hit home, triggering an emotional response from Trump on Twitter. “Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words ‘nice’ or ‘compassion,’ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,” he tweeted. “The U.S. has not forgotten Iran’s use of IED’s & EFP’s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more … Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.” The statements from Trump seem to contradict other US officials, who say the US wants to negotiate with Iran rather than escalate the dispute. “The United States is not looking to go to war with Iran,” said Mark T. Esper, the acting defense secretary. “Rather, we want to get to a diplomatic path.” Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, also insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door.”. 

Q: Did Trump threaten to destroy Iran?
A: No. He tweeted that Iran would be held fully responsible, and that they would pay a very big price. It stated that was a threat, not a warning. But the tweet did not mention destroying Iran, only holding them accountable..

A: The Benghazi attacks killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. 

It’s true that the State Department did not honor requests for more security prior to the attacks, but there was no evidence that Clinton was made aware of those requests. 

As for Clinton’s response, none of the many congressional investigations about the attacks asserted (as Trump did) that she was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred.

Moreover, it was not Clinton’s responsibility to send troops to the scene — the military chain of command took that responsibility. The Defense Department attempted to send help to the scene, but was unable to reach Benghazi before the deaths occurred..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Questions doesn't help to acertain if the Russian government intend to close off the Russian Internet or not 

Evidence:

Q: What is the Russian Sovereign Internet law?
A: The law requires internet service providers to install network equipment - known as deep packet inspection (DPI) - capable of identifying the source of traffic and filter content. In practice, this will allow the country's telecommunications watchdog Roskomnadzor to be more effective at blocking sites.. 

Q: What will the law allow the authorities to do ?
A: It gives the Kremlin the possibility to switch off connections within Russia or completely to the worldwide web ""in an emergency"". It is up to the government to decide what constitutes a threat and what actions should be taken.

Russia is seeking to route the country's web traffic and data through state-controlled points, reducing reliance on foreign servers over which it has less control.. 

Q: Could the law be used to block global internet from Russian users?
A: Yes, Campaigners say the law, which was signed by President Vladimir Putin earlier this year, is an attempt to increase censorship, building on the internet legislation that already curtails freedom of expression and privacy.

""Now the government can directly censor content or even turn Russia's internet into a closed system without telling the public what they are doing or why,"" said Rachel Denber, Human Rights Watch's deputy Europe and Central Asia director.

The law, observers say, allows the government to block content without judicial consent and leaves users unaware about what information is being blocked and why.

Christian Mihr, from the group Reporters Without Borders, said: ""[The law] proves that the Russian leadership is ready to bring the entire network infrastructure under political control in order to cut off the digital information flow whenever needed."".

Justification: Not enough evidence provided in QA pairs to support or refute the claim.

Evidence:

Q: Does the United States send fish caught in the country to Asia for processing and then re-import it back to the United States?
A: Yes. An estimated $900 million in fish and seafood on that list (of proposed tariffs) is first caught in the U.S., sent to China for processing into items like fish sticks and fillets, and then imported by U.S. companies to sell to American consumers.

A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: Are there reliable figures to account for domestic consumption of fish and its origin?
A: No. Unfortunately, a dark cloud looms over seafood trade as tariffs recently imposed by the United States and retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other countries hit US seafood exporters and importers, resulting in higher seafood prices for US consumers. Accounting for the realities of globalized supply chains is not only needed for better statistics that support evidence-based policy but is also key to supporting the US seafood industry, achieving sustainable production, and meeting consumer demand.

That’s why the passage of the First Step Act tonight is so meaningful – it begins to right past wrongs that continue to deny justice to millions of Americans.

“This bill is a step forward for our criminal justice system. By no means can it be the only step – it must be the beginning of a long effort to restore justice to our justice system.

“But for the first time in a long time, with the passage of this bill into law, our country will make a meaningful break from the decades of failed policies that led to mass incarceration, which has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, drained our economy, compromised public safety, hurt our children, and disproportionately harmed communities of color while devaluing the very idea of justice in America.”

Before you complain and decide satire is synonymous with “comedy”: sat·ire ˈsaˌtī(ə)r noun: The use of humor, irony, exaggeration, OR ridicule to expose and criticize people’s stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues. Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined. Any similarities between this site’s pure fantasy and actual people, places, and events are purely coincidental and all images should be considered altered and satirical. See above if you’re still having an issue with that satire thing..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: from the 2nd question and answer pair it seems that the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: Where was this claim posted?
A: At the daily world update, a clearly labelled satire news site. The Daily World Update site is part of the ""America's Last Line of Defense"" network of satire websites. Self-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair runs those sites. The Maine resident works alongside a loose confederation of friends and allies. Blair has been in a feud with fact-checking website Snopes, and he has also criticized other fact-checkers who labeled his work ""fake news"" instead of satire. In reaction, he has recently rebranded all his active websites and Facebook pages, so they carry prominent disclaimers everywhere.. 

Q: Did Pelosi approve 4.8 million in impeachment fees?
A: The story is not true and is clearly labeled as satire. Pelosi did not approve these fees, and as a non-profit organization, the Clinton Foundation would not have the expertise to provide consultations on the impeachment hearings. President Trump was impeached by the House on December 18, 2019. Pelosi, as Speaker, has control over when the process is handed over to the Senate - a chamber she fears is not willing to hold a ""fair"" trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers and sources show the amount in California is a lot less that 10 million so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: How many people are living illegally in the united states?
A: There were 12 million immigrants living in the country illegally as of January 2015, according to the most recent estimate from the Department of Homeland Security. Most recent estimates from two independent groups are similar: The Pew Research Center estimates the number at 10.5 million in 2017, and the Center for Migration Studies says there were 10.7 million people in 2017 living in the U.S. illegally.. 

Q: How many people are living illegally in California?
A: As for California, estimates for the number of residents living in the state illegally range from 2 million to 3.1 million.

The Pew Research Center estimated the number was 2 million in 2017, down from 2.2 million in 2016, and the Department of Homeland Security says that it was around 2.9 million in 2015. Based on 2012-2016 data from the Census Bureau, the Migration Policy Institute concluded the undocumented population was 3.1 million..

Justification: Putin has supported their work and there is evidence of that from 2011.

Evidence:

Q: Does Wagner operate outside Russian borders
A: Yes. Mercenaries are illegal under Russian law, but that doesn’t stop them from being a central element of the Kremlin’s geopolitical adventurism, whether in Ukraine or, even more clearly, Syria. The tale of Wagner, a St Petersburg outfit at the heart of the fighting in Syria, says much about the privatisation of statecraft and the mobilisation of private enterprise in modern Russia.

Q: Has President Putin ever supported the idea of Wagner

averitec_1498,Fact Check: CNN admitted the Entire Russian Collusion Theory Was A Hoax,"Claim: CNN admitted the Entire Russian Collusion Theory Was A Hoax

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the Q&A it seems CNN never said what is in the claim, so it is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: Where was it claimed that CNN admitted the entire Russian collusion theory was a hoax?
A: The claim was made in the headline of an article on the website Last Minute News (TheLast-News.com):
""CNN Breaks Down, Finally Admits Entire Russian Collusion Theory Was A Hoax"". 

Q: Does the content of the article on the Last Minute News website make the same claim as its headline (that CNN admitted the Russian collusion theory was a hoax)?
A: No. The article states:
“It must have been very painful for the folks at CNN to write the report below, but it sure looks like the entire Russian collusion thing was a hoax perpetrated by rogue elements of the FBI, as CNN reports:

""A former FBI lawyer is under criminal investigation after allegedly altering a document related to 2016 surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser, several people briefed on the matter told CNN.

The possibility of a substantive change to an investigative document is likely to fuel accusations from President Donald Trump and his allies that the FBI committed wrongdoing in its investigation of connections between Russian election meddling and the Trump campaign.””

Q: Does the CNN article on which the claim is based state that the Russian collusion theory is a hoax?
A: No. There is no mention of the Russian collusion theory being a hoax, the article states:
“American intelligence agencies and the Justice Department have not swayed from their finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking the Democrats and spreading pro-Trump propaganda online. And even former top Trump campaign officials have corroborated special counsel Robert Mueller’s finding that the Trump campaign planned some of its strategy around the Russian hacks, and had multiple contacts with Kremlin-linked individuals in 2016”.

averitec_1499,Fact Check: Nigel Farage stated Nearly two-thirds of British businesses do not make a profit...,"Claim: Nigel Farage stated Nearly two-thirds of British businesses do not make a profit of over £10,000 but are subjected to corporation tax.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The claim begins and is phrased as ""Nigel Farage stated..."" - because of this, the question and answer pairs should therefore be structured in order to verify the authenticity of the alleged quote in the claim. The source document for question 1 lists Nigel Farage as both the leader of the Brexit Party and the first signatory to this Brexit Party ""Contract with the people"" document. The statement referring to Corporation Tax and most relevant to the claim within the document states - ""one million companies - some 66% of the total number - pay less than £10,000. This represents just 6% of Corporation Tax take in 2019; £3.4bn. Total cost £5.1bn per year."" It doesn't discuss two thirds of British businesses not making a profit of over £10,000, rather that they propose to Zero rate Corporation Tax for the first £10,000 of pre-tax profits. Also the source document in answer 1 doesn't discuss - ""fewer than half of British businesses make a profit of less than £10,000"" as referenced in answer 1.

Evidence:

Q: Is it true that 2/3 of British businesses do not make a profit of over £10,000 but are subjected to corporation tax ?
A: This is incorrect. Two-thirds of limited companies have corporation tax liabilities of up to £10,000, but fewer than half of British businesses make a profit of less than £10,000..

Evidence:

Q: What is partisan?
A: showing strong and usually unfair support for one particular person, group, or idea. 

Q: What is gerrymandering?
A: Gerrymandering in the United States has been used to increase the power of a political party. Gerrymandering is the practice of setting boundaries of electoral districts to favor specific political interests within legislative bodies, often resulting in districts with convoluted, winding boundaries rather than compact areas. The term ""gerrymandering"" was coined after a review of Massachusetts's redistricting maps of 1812 set by Governor Elbridge Gerry noted that one of the districts looked like a salamander.. 

Q: What is redistrictng in the US?
A: In the United States, redistricting takes place in each state about every ten years, after the decennial census. It defines geographical boundaries, with each district within a state being geographically contiguous and having about the same number of state voters. The resulting map affects the elections of the state's members of the United States House of Representatives and the state legislative bodies..

Q: How is the NHS funded?
A: How is the NHS in England currently funded?

The NHS is funded mainly through general taxation supplemented by National Insurance contributions.

While the NHS is generally described as being ‘free at the point of use’, patients have been required to contribute towards the cost of some services (eg, prescriptions and dental treatment) since 1951. Exemption arrangements are in place that cover many patients, including those aged under 16 or 60 and over, as well as recipients of specific state benefits. The exemptions in place resulted in 90 per cent of all prescription items in England being dispensed free of charge last year (Health and Social Care Information Centre 2016).

The relative contribution from each of these sources of finance – general taxation, National Insurance and user charges – has fluctuated over the years (see Commission on the Future of Health and Social Care in England 2014b). For example, the proportion of income from user charges, from a high of 5 per cent in 1960 remained at 1.2 per cent between 2007 and 2011 (Hawe and Cockcroft 2013)..

averitec_1517,Fact Check: President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election.,"Claim: President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: ""Fired"" is a strong word to be used in this claim. ""Political ambassadors sometimes are permitted to stay on briefly during a new administration..."" are the words used in the source evidence. Therefore cherry-picking is the claim label chosen.

Evidence:

Q: Did Obama remove all previously appointed Bush Ambassadors when he took office?
A: The incoming Obama administration has notified all politically-appointed ambassadors that they must vacate their posts as of Jan. 20, the day President-elect Barack Obama takes the oath of office, a State Department official said.

The clean slate will open up prime opportunities for the president-elect to reward political supporters with posts in London, Paris, Tokyo and the like. The notice to diplomatic posts was issued this week.

Political ambassadors sometimes are permitted to stay on briefly during a new administration, but the sweeping nature of the directive suggests that Obama has little interest in retaining any of Bush's ambassadorial appointees.

Most ambassadors, of course, are foreign service officers, but often the posts involving the most important bilateral relations (such as with Great Britain, Japan and India) or desirable locales (such as the Bahamas) are given to close friends and well-heeled contributors of the president.. 

Q: Were they Fired?
A: No they rotated out of their positions as political appointees do with every administration..

Justification: The evidence finds that the claim came from data which is not as reliable. The correct figure on Scotland's youth employment in 2019 was an increase of 0.9 percentage points.

Evidence:

Q: Where does the data for this claim come from?
A: X02 Regional labour market: Estimates of unemployment by age. 

Q: How much did the rate of youth employment change  in 2019?
A: In the year to July 2019, youth unemployment in Scotland increased by 0.9 percentage points.. 

Q: What is the view of the independent UK Statistics Authority on the claim?
A: Data from the LFS at this level of detail are not considered reliable, and are not classed as National Statistics. The APS is the more reliable data source for estimates of youth unemployment, due to its larger sample size, particularly when considering a breakdown by age and country within the UK. It would be helpful to make this clear both in the summary published by the Scottish Government and any related use of the estimates, including on social media.

We welcome the Scottish Government’s commitment to working with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to improve the presentation of youth unemployment rates in Scotland, and its wish to consider whether it is appropriate to continue publishing estimates based on the LFS..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems from the last QA as confederate veterans are not mentioned, in the documents, that the label is refuted

Evidence:

Q: Did Congress make a law to Designate Confederate Soldiers as United States Veterans?
A: No portion of the law appears to confer any privilege other than markers for graves of Confederate soldiers, nor does it grant Confederate soldiers status equal to those of veterans of the United States military.. 

Q: When were the last recorded confederate solders deaths?
A: The last recorded Confederate soldier deaths were in 1959, meaning that the 1957 law had negligible effects for those under its provisions, and in any event the law again conferred no status or other benefit to Confederate soldiers themselves..

Q: How is inequality measured ?
A: Both income and wealth inequality are commonly measured with the Gini index or coefficient. This is a measure that provides a figure between 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality),. 

Q: What is South Africa's Gini Coefficient?
A: The report says that in 2015, South Africa had a Gini coefficient of 0.63. This was based on individual consumption – one of the ways to measure income inequality. 

This put South Africa at the top of a list of 164 countries. Namibia’s Gini coefficient of 0.59 placed it second, with Suriname, Zambia and the Central African Republic next on the list.. 

Q: Is the Gini Coefficient a reliable  way to measure inequality?
A: The first is the data on which the calculation is based. Sulla said “sampling errors” in the 2014/15 Living Conditions Survey were likely. 

“The data is a survey, not a census of every family in South Africa.” 

Country surveys also differ in terms of methodology and types of measures, which can make comparing the data tricky, he said..

Justification: The credible sources do not show any evidence that Gandhi said those words. The first answer shows a similar quote in 1919. Therefore the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

A: Indeed, the website Quote Investigator found the earliest “substantive” match in a speech Klein delivered at an Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America conference that year.

“And, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement,” Klein said during the address. “First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.”. 

Q: Can this quote be attributed to Gandhi?

Q: Does the NHS now have 200,000 fewer nurses than in 2010?
A: No. In June 2018, there were around 2,700 more nurses and health visitors (full-time equivalent) working for the NHS than in June 2010 (a 1% increase).

Q: Is the figure quoted of 200,000 just for resignations?
A: No. Over the eight years Labour looked at, just under 97,000 of the 200,000 nurses and health visitors had ‘voluntary resignation’ recorded as a reason for leaving—the single most common reason for leaving.

In the year to June 2011, 50% of nursing staff who had a reason for leaving recorded, voluntarily resigned. By the year ending June 2018, this had increased to 63%.

In total, around a third of voluntary resignations between June 2010 and 2018 did not have a specific reason for them recorded. Around a quarter were listed as being due to relocation and around one in five cited ‘work life balance’. Just under one in ten resigned for reasons relating to promotion.

Justification: Matt Gaetz has had only one DUI and not numerous as the claim suggests 

Evidence:

Q: How many DUI's had Matt Gaetz recieved by the time of the claim?
A: One in 2008. 

Q: What was the outcome of the 2008 DUI Gaetz received and was there any evidence that his father was involved in the outcome?
A: According to an article by Tampa Bay Times, - He didn't have his license suspended for a year when he refused the breath test — as Florida law dictates. And he didn't have that refusal used against him in a criminal proceeding. Charges against Gaetz were dismissed after events that included, among other things, the forced resignation of the arresting officer. No evidence was put forward that Gaetz’s “dad got him off.”.

Q: What the overall employment rate like under Trump's administration?
A: ...the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent as the country emerged from pandemic lockdowns, but the data shows the recovery is losing steam.

A: Deposit insurance - Banks have to incorporate information about ‘deposit insurance cover’ along with the limit of coverage ...
Deposit insurance protects the depositors from losing their money in full. It ensures part recovery. So in case of a bank failure, a depositor doesn’t lose all their money..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: It looks as though some flu vaccines do contain polysorbate 80, although there have been concerns about polysorbate 80 and its relationship with infertility. It doesn't look as though there has been much research or reporting done on the links. Except for one report, which saw a total of six cases? There is also no information on whether polysorbate 80 can induce liver failure. Therefore, this leaves an aspect of the claim neither supported nor refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Do any UK flu vaccines contain polysorbate 80?
A: Yes. Fluad

Q: Why is there an adjuvant in vaccines?
A: It helps promote a better immune response. Adjuvants also reduce the amount of virus needed for production of a vaccine, which can allow for greater supplies of vaccine to be manufactured.. 

Q: Are there concerns about polysorbate 80's affect on fertility?
A: they raise concerns about Polysorbate 80 and its relationship with infertility. They state that up to the age of 12, children receive a combined 0.8 mg of Polysorbate 80 administered through the Australian childhood vaccination schedule. This figure should not be considered a cause for concern, as 0.8 mg of Polysorbate 80 (the cumulative dose over 12 years) is >90 000 times lower than the acute exposure dose (based on rat intravenous LD50 of 1790 mg/kg5) for a 41 kg 12-year-old girl or >6700 times lower for a 3 kg infant. The animal study,6 cited by Little and Ward, examining Polysorbate 80 toxicity on neonatal rats (over 4 days) gave doses equivalent to 550–5500 times higher than the entire exposure a human child gets by the age of 12..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Although the third answer says 3.91% I'll assume some rounding differences in the underlying figures and judge it close enough to support the claim. 
Also the wording of the claim seems to be making the point that 3.95% is a low amount, so the evidence pointing to 3.91% does not undermine the claim.

Evidence:

Q: How much was the NIgerian 2018 budget?
A: N9.12 trillion.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: the benefits do not included free health care, but subsidised health care

Evidence:

Q: what kind of health insurance do members of congress get ?
A: Congressional health benefits
Before the Affordable Care Act, Congress and staffers got their health care through employer-provided insurance, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. During the ACA debate, the idea that members of Congress would not be subject to the exchanges became a big political issue. So, the final ""ACA"" (Obamacare) required lawmakers and staffers to get their insurance through the local health exchange, the District of Columbia’s small business health options program (SHOP) exchange.

For the 2017 plan year, there were 57 plan options in the gold tier on the DC SHOP. Members and staff have to choose at least the gold option to receive the employer contribution, which is figured at 72% of the weighted average of all FEHB plan premiums.  

Once a member or staffer is no longer in federal service, they have an option to enroll in an FEHB plan under Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC) that they pay for (like COBRA).

Want more details on the Congressional health benefits? This CRS Report has you covered.

Congressional retirement benefits
Up until 1984, federal employees (including Members of Congress) did not pay Social Security taxes or receive Social Security benefits but were instead covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Members elected after 1984 are covered by the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS).

Like other federal employees, Congressional pensions are financed through employee and employer contributions. Members pay Social Security payroll taxes equal to 6.2% Social Security taxes and contribute to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF).

Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at age 62 (with at least five years of service), age 50 (with at least twenty years of service), or at any age (after 25 years of service). ""The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of
salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member’s ret. 

Q: Do members of members of congress gets free health care?
A: Before the Affordable Care Act, senators and representatives used to receive health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which was similar to health insurance programs at large companies. That means that the employer (in this case, the U.S. government) makes a contribution toward the health insurance plan selected by the employee. Under the Affordable Care Act, the government still covers a portion of the costs but the plans have to be purchased on a D.C. exchange called D.C. Health Link.. 

Q: What Benefits Do Members Of Congress Get After They Leave Office?
A: A sitting Member of Congress earns a salary of $174,000/year. That ends when he or she is no longer in office. But, depending on when the Member was elected, that person does receive a pension, access to a 401(k)-like retirement account and, in many cases Social Security benefits. Members of Congress started paying into Social Security in 1984. These benefits are generally the same as other federal employees would receive.

According to the Congressional Research Service, members are eligible for the pension at age 62 if they've served five years or more. (They are eligible at earlier ages with more years of service.).

The home was worth $800,000 at the time of his uncle’s death. If David decides to sell the house, his basis will be $800,000 so he will only be taxed on the difference between what he sold it for and his new stepped-up basis of $800,000..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the evidence, it appears that the Constitution doesn’t offer specific guidance on rules for impeachment inquiries and that the House determines its own rules of parliamentary conduct. Hence, the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Has the impeachment process in the US ever not gone through the Judiciary Committee?
A: In 1867, after the Judiciary Committee voted to not send articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson to the full House, a second attempt to impeach him succeeded after an inquiry by the Committee on Reconstruction..

A: The Constitution doesn’t offer specific guidance on rules for impeachment inquiries and the House determines its own rules of parliamentary conduct.

averitec_1694,Fact Check: 1 in 6 in the US get food poisoning each year but only 1 in 66 in the UK.,"Claim: 1 in 6 in the US get food poisoning each year but only 1 in 66 in the UK.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Evidence throughout the QA brings up a slight conflict against the claim. It seems that the stats of 1 in 6 for the US getting food poisoning is relatively true, it's based on a 2011 report but the CDC suggests it's a fairly accurate statistic, further evidence seems to suggest that it's hard to estimate the exact numbers with one reason being not all people report to the doctor with food poisoning and it's hard to always proove it was something they ate made them ill in the first place leaving room for inaccuracy which makes the claim conflicted because that part suggests the claim may be wrong. Based on the numbers the 1 in 66 part may be true for the UK, stats are not comparable between the countries and the way it's recorded because of differences in the countries medical care and the methodology behind the estimates may differ.

Evidence:

Q: Where does the 1 in 66 estimate come from?
A: The estimate that one in 66 people in the UK gets food poisoning is based on a 2011 FSA report. It estimated that in the UK a million people a year suffer a foodborne illness. The population of the UK today is around 66 million, which the original claimant seems to have used to get one in 66.. 

Q: Is this an accurate statistic?
A: No. It’s difficult to estimate the number of people who get food poisoning a year. It’s not always possible to prove someone got ill because of something they’d eaten, and they may not always go to a doctor or seek medical advice. As a result the estimates are broad.

Q: Where does the one in 6 figure come from?
A: The figure of one in six for the US comes from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which estimates that “each year roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people)” get sick as a result of foodborne diseases.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Although evidence states what Medicare for All and Medicare are, there is no evidence on whether the U.S. Democratic proposals for universal health care would completely obliterate Medicare. Although ""Medicare for All"" means the government will be the ""single payer"" on any health expenses, there is no clarification of what this means, especially in relation to socialism. There is also no mention of the public option. Hence, there is not enough evidence.

Evidence:

Q: What is Medicare for All?
A: Sanders' plan is a ""single-payer"" plan. That means the government will be the ""single payer"" on any health expenses. Right now, there are lots and lots of payers in the U.S. health care system — insurance companies, the federal government, states and so on.. 

Q: What is Medicare?
A: Generally, Medicare is available for people age 65 or older, younger people with disabilities and people with End Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or transplant). Medicare has two parts, Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medicare Insurance). You are eligible for premium-free Part A if you are age 65 or older and you or your spouse worked and paid Medicare taxes for at least 10 years. You can get Part A at age 65 without having to pay premiums if:

You are receiving retirement benefits from Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board.

A: While lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have been on record objecting to any elimination of protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, the administration’s proposal to extend short-term health insurance plans that are inadequate for someone diagnosed with a serious illness such as cancer would reintroduce discrimination based on health history,.

Justification: The WHO does not have a recommendation regarding ratio of drs to patients so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Has WHO recommended a doctor to patient ratio ?
A: The agency had not prescribed any ideal ratio of healthcare workers to population.

he concept of a healthcare worker to population ratio appears to have leapt out of the 2004 findings of the Joint Learning Initiative, a Harvard University-backed network of global health leaders. The report suggested that a density of 2.5 workers per 1,000 people would help reduce deaths of children and mothers. But it did not set this as a general healthcare staffing goal.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The claim seems true, Trump made changes to SNAP so people who need the money get it. 

Evidence:

Q: What changes were made to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program by Donald Trump
A: To confer automatic eligibility for SNAP under the proposal, a household must receive TANF-funded cash or non-cash benefits valued at a minimum of $50 per month for at least 6 months. In addition, non-cash benefits that could convey automatic eligibility would be restricted to subsidized employment, work supports, or childcare. By establishing clear standards and requiring that benefits be ongoing and substantial, the proposal will ensure SNAP benefits go toward Americans most in need.. 

Q: what would this proposed rule fix
A: The proposed rule would fix a loophole that has expanded SNAP recipients in some states to include people who receive assistance when they clearly don’t need it. In fact, the depth of this specific flexibility has become so egregious that a millionaire living in Minnesota successfully enrolled in the program simply to highlight the waste of taxpayer money. This proposal gives USDA the ability to save billions of dollars, ensuring nutrition assistance programs are delivered with consistency and integrity to those most in need.. 

Q: Who does the head of the Department of Agriculture report to?
A: It is headed by the Secretary of Agriculture, who reports directly to the President of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet..

averitec_1719,Fact Check: The most serious violent and sexual offenders receive automatic early release fr...,"Claim: The most serious violent and sexual offenders receive automatic early release from prison halfway through their sentence.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: this isn't an automatic release, it seems to depend on the offender and how dangerous they are. 

Evidence:

Q: What are the standard terms of a custodial sentence in the UK?
A: A determinate prison sentence is where the court sets a fixed length for the prison sentence and is the most common type of prison sentence. For example, an offender may be sentenced to four years in prison. This is the maximum period of time the offender could spend in prison. However, the offender will not necessarily spend the whole of this time in prison.

The rules governing when a prisoner is released vary depending on the length of the sentence and when the offence was committed.. 

Q: How much time would be spent in prison under a standard determinate sentence?
A: Offenders sentenced to two years or more will serve half their sentence in prison and serve the rest of the sentence in the community on licence.  While on licence an offender will be subject to supervision and the licence will include conditions. If an offender breaches their conditions, they may be recalled to prison.. 

Q: Can judges hand down extended custodial sentences?
A: Yes. These sentences were introduced to provide extra protection to the public in certain types of cases where the court has found that the offender is dangerous and an extended licence period is required to protect the public from risk of harm. The judge decides how long the offender should stay in prison and also fixes the extended licence period up to a maximum of eight years. The offender will either be entitled to automatic release at the two thirds point of the custodial sentence or be entitled to apply for parole at that point.

Justification: No. “To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Meseris said in a statement Wednesday. “The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

Evidence:

Q: Where does the claim come from that Hunter Biden got China to put $1.5bn in a fund?
A: Book by Peter Schweizer, “Secret Empires,” that first detailed how Hunter Biden flew to China on Air Force Two with his father in 2013.. 

Q: What does the book claim?
A: Schweizer wrote in a summary of the 2018 book that 10 days after the Bidens arrived in China, “Hunter Biden’s firm scored a $1.5 billion deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.”. 

Q: Did the Chinese put $1.5bn into a fund involving Hunter Biden?
A: No. “To date, Mr. Biden has not received any return or compensation on account of this investment or his position on the board of directors,” Meseris said in a statement Wednesday. “The characterization of Mr. Biden as owning a $1.5 billion private equity firm funded by the Chinese, or suggesting that Mr. Biden has earned millions of dollars from the firm is a gross misrepresentation of Mr. Biden’s role with BHR.”

averitec_1738,"Fact Check: Russian Energy Narrative Targets Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic States","Claim: Russian Energy Narrative Targets Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic States

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the Q&As you can see that Ukraine, Poland and the Ukraine are adverse to Russian Energy. 

Evidence:

Q: Why is Ukraine adverse to Russian energy
A: The Nord Stream 2 infrastructure would enable Gazprom to cut Ukraine out of gas transit traffic, which could cost the country about $2 billion in transit fees (the equivalent of nearly 6 percent of its projected budget for 2018). Revenues aside, as Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently stated in Berlin, the real danger lies in the fact that Russia can launch a massive land offensive against Ukraine without fear of damaging Ukraine’s pipeline infrastructure and interrupting Gazprom’s exports to Western countries.. 

Q: why is Poland adverse to Russian energy
A: The General Court next examines Poland’s argument that the 2016 decision breaches the principle 
of energy solidarity 8
in that it enables Gazprom and undertakings in the Gazprom group to redirect
additional volumes of gas onto the EU market by fully exploiting the capacities of the North Stream 
1 pipeline. Taking into account the lack of significant growth in demand for natural gas in central 
Europe, according to Poland, that would, as its only possible consequence, influence the 
conditions of supply and use of transmission services on the pipelines competing with OPAL. The 
General Court observes, in that regard, that that principle imposes not only obligations of mutual 
assistance where, for example following natural disasters or acts of terrorism, a Member State is in 
a critical or emergency situation as regards its gas supply, but also requires the European Union 
and the Member States to endeavour, in the exercise of their powers in the field of energy policy,
to avoid adopting measures likely to affect the interests of the EU and other Member States as 
regards security of supply, its economic and political viability, the diversification of supply or of 
sources of supply, and to do so in order to take account of their interdependence and de facto 
solidarity..

Q: Was there a shortfall in government earnings in 2018-19 to the tune of Rs.1.7 lakh crores?
A: There is a difference which amounted to Rs. 1.7 lakh crores between the ‘Provisional Actuals’ of revenue receipts provided in the Economic Survey of India and the ‘Revised Estimates’ of revenue receipts as reported by the government for 2018-19. Since provisional actuals (PA) may be a better estimate of the actual figures, there could well be a shortfall in government earnings for 2018-19. Hence the claim is TRUE..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: this is true, it was passed in 1970 and 71 and championed by Martin Luther King

Q: How many times did the Universal Basic Income bill make it to the House in the1970s
A: President Nixon's plan for a radical revision of the nation's welfare system was approved by the House with a vote of 243 to 155 in 1970.

A: Yes. “I am now convinced that the simplest solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a new widely discussed measure: the guaranteed income,” he wrote in his 1967 book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?

Q: How did founding father Thomas Paine view Universal income
A: Thomas Paine was among the first to argue that a basic income should be introduced as a kind of compensation for dispossession. In his brilliant 1797 pamphlet Agrarian Justice, he pointed out that “the earth, in its natural, uncultivated state was, and ever would have continued to be, the common property of the human race”. It was unfair that a few should enclose it for their own benefit, leaving the vast majority without their rightful inheritance. As far as Paine was concerned, this violated the most basic principles of justice..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: They did carry out raids but much less than the previous government and other tactics were used to help the situation first. So even though the claim is not correct, its not a completely cut and dry label. 

Evidence:

Q: What are 'workplace raids'?
A: The are raids carried out by Government officials to combat worker exploitation, illegal wages, child labour and to combat illegal immigrants working unlawfully in the U.S.. 

Q: Were any workplace raids carried out when Obama was president of the U.S?
A: Yes. But Government data on worksite enforcement operations shows that the number of individuals arrested on immigration law violation charges declined after Obama took office.

Q: What was the ICE doing under Obama's jurisdiction
A: Under current Department of Homeland Security (DHS) guidance on immigration-relatedworksite enforcement, the agency uses available civil and administrative tools, including civilfines and debarment, to penalize and prevent unlawful employment. According to 2012 estimates,there are some 8.1 million unauthorized workers in the U.S. civilian labor force.DHS’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is responsible for immigration-relatedworksite enforcement, or enforcement of the prohibitions on unauthorized employment in Section274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA Section 274A provisions,sometimes referred to as employer sanctions, make it unlawful for an employer to knowinglyhire, recruit or refer for a fee, or continue to employ an alien who is not authorized to be soemployed. Today, ICE’s worksite enforcement program is focused primarily on cases that involvecritical infrastructure facilities and cases involving employers who commit “egregious” violationsof criminal statutes and engage in worker exploitation.Employers who violate INA prohibitions on the unlawful employment of aliens may be subject tocivil monetary penalties and/or criminal penalties. Criminal investigations may result indefendants being charged with crimes beyond unlawful employment and being subject to therelevant penalties for those violations.

Although back pain can occur after an epidural is given, there is ""no evidence that an epidural can cause permanent back pain"". Therefore this claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: What are the side effects of Epidural injections ?
A: Epidurals are very safe; serious complications are extremely rare. However, as with all medications and medical procedures, there are potential side effects:

    Decrease in blood pressure – The medication may lower your blood pressure, which may slow your baby’s heart rate. To make this less likely, you will be given extra fluids through a tube in your arm (IV), and you may need to lie on your side. Sometimes, your anesthesiologist will give you a medication to maintain your blood pressure.
    Sore back – Your lower back may be sore where the needle was inserted to deliver the medication. This soreness should last no more than a few days. There is no evidence that an epidural can cause permanent back pain.
    Headache – On rare occasions, the needle pierces the covering of the spinal cord, which can cause a headache that may last for a few days if left untreated. If this situation arises, discuss the treatment options with your anesthesiologist.. 

Q: Does epidural injections work on every pregnant woman?

Verdict: Supported

Justification: this is supported, the answers show that the blacklist existed, and lost the people the right to work, and one even killed themselves. 

Evidence:

Q: When did the blacklist take place
A: The blacklist Goldberg mentioned took place during the 1940s and 1950s, as the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union heated up.. 

Q: What is the Hollywood blacklist based on?
A: In October 1947, 10 members of the Hollywood film industry publicly denounced the tactics employed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), an investigative committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, during its probe of alleged communist influence in the American motion picture business. These prominent screenwriters and directors, who became known as the Hollywood Ten, received jail sentences and were banned from working for the major Hollywood studios. Their defiant stands also placed them at center stage in a national debate over the controversial anti-communist crackdown that swept through the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Besides the Hollywood Ten, other members of the film industry with alleged communist ties were later banned from working for the big movie studios. The Hollywood blacklist came to an end in the 1960s.. 

Q: Were those who were blacklisted denied their right to work?
A: The studios pledged never again to employ a known Communist or unrepentant fellow traveler. At the studios and the networks, hundreds of artists were shown the door — or had it shut in their faces. Johnston’s declaration marked the formal onset of the blacklist era, a two-decade-long purgatory during which political allegiances, real or suspected, determined employment opportunities in the entertainment industry..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There have been improvements in the life expectancy, howbeit slow. 

Evidence:

Q: How is life expectancy measured?
A: A cohort life table shows the probability of a person from a given cohort dying at each age over the course of their lifetime. In this context, a cohort refers to a group of people with the same year of birth.

The cohort life table is based on age-specific probabilities of death, which are calculated using observed deaths (mortality) data from the cohort.. 

Q: Has life expectancy in the UK been falling?
A: No. “The slowdown in life expectancy improvements in the UK has continued, as 2015 to 2017 saw the lowest improvements in life expectancy since the start of the series in 1980 to 1982. Some decreases in life expectancy at birth have been seen in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland whilst in England life expectancy has remained unchanged from 2014 to 2016. This slowing in improvements is reflected in the chances of surviving to age 90 years from birth, which has also seen virtually no improvement since 2012 to 2014.”

averitec_1790,Fact Check: America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors,"Claim: America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Q.1 confirms that there are no Black US governors. Q.2 confirms that Gov. Kay Ivey wore blackface from her time as an Auburn student. Hence, this claim is supported. 

Evidence:

Q: How many US governors are black?
A: None.
Forty-seven of the nation’s governors are non-Hispanic white.* Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM) is Hispanic and David Ige (D-HI) is Asian. Kevin Stitt (R-OK) is a member of the Cherokee Nation.. 

Q: Have any US governors worn blackface?
A: Yes. Gov. Kay Ivey is contacting state legislators, and apologizing for her role in a racist student skit from her time as an Auburn student.

Ivey was president of her Alpha Gamma Delta pledge class at Auburn. Photos of her sorority sisters in blackface emerged earlier this year. None showed the governor.

But Thursday she apologized after audio emerged of a skit at a Baptist Student Union Party. The audio is a radio interview of Ivey and her then-fiance, Ben LaRavia. He describes Ivey as wearing blue coveralls and said she “had put some black paint all over her face.”

Q: What is ""blackface""
A: We define blackface as “black makeup worn (as by a performer in a minstrel show) in a caricature of the appearance of a black person,” and also as “a performer wearing such makeup.” This definition is accompanied by a usage note: “The wearing of blackface by white performers was, from the early 19th through the mid-20th centuries, a prominent feature of minstrel shows and similar forms of entertainment featuring exaggerated and inaccurate caricatures of black people. Its modern occurrence in imitation of such performers is considered deeply offensive.”.

averitec_1792,Fact Check: contraceptive pills can cause cancer.,"Claim: contraceptive pills can cause cancer.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Some pills can increase the risk of cancer. 

Evidence:

Q: Do contraceptive pills causes cancer ?
A: The Pill and cancer

While high dose Pills reduce your risk of cancer of the ovary and womb if used in the long term, it is not clear whether lower dose Pills like Femodene ED also provide the same protective effects. However, it also seems that taking the Pill slightly increases your risk of cancer of the cervix – although this may be due to having sex without a condom, rather than the Pill. All women should have regular smear tests.

If you have breast cancer, or have had it in the past, you should not take the Pill. The Pill slightly increases your risk of breast cancer. This risk goes up the longer you’re on the Pill, but returns to normal within about 10 years of stopping it. Because breast cancer is rare in women under the age of 40, the extra cases of breast cancer in current and recent Pill users is small. For example:

    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 16 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early twenties, about 17–18 will have breast cancer by the time they are 35 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who have never taken the Pill, about 100 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.
    Of 10,000 women who take the Pill for 5 years in their early thirties, about 110 will have breast cancer by the time they are 45 years old.

Your risk of breast cancer is higher:

    if you have a close relative (mother, sister or grandmother) who has had breast cancer
    if you are seriously overweight

    See a doctor as soon as possible if you notice any changes in your breasts, such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple or any lumps you can see or feel.

Taking the Pill has also been linked to liver diseases, such as jaundice and non-cancer liver tumours, but this is rare. Very rarely, the Pill has also been linked with some forms of liver cancer in women who have taken it for a long time.. 

Q: What is the name of birth control pills that causes cancer ?
A: The combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), often referred to as the birth control pill or colloquially as ""the pill"", is a type of birth control that is designed to be taken orally by women. It includes a combination of an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) and a progestogen (specifically a progestin). When taken correctly, it alters the menstrual cycle to eliminate ovulation and prevent pregnancy.

They were first approved for contraceptive use in the United States in 1960, and are a very popular form of birth control. They are used by more than 100 million women worldwide and by almost 12 million females in the United States.[9] From 2015 to 2017, 12.6% of women aged 15–49 in the US reported using oral contraception, making it the second most common method of contraception in this age range with female sterilization being the most common method.[10] Use varies widely by country,[11] age, education, and marital status. For example, one third of women aged 16–49 in the United Kingdom currently use either the combined pill or progestogen-only pill (POP),[12][13] compared with less than 3% of women in Japan (as of 1950–2014).[14]

Combined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[15] The pill was a catalyst for the sexual revolution.[16].

Evidence:

Q: Where did this story originate?
A: The story originated from an article published by The Chester Bugle on August 23, 2019 titled ""Nokia 3310 found in drawer after 20 years still has 70% battery""
The Chester Bugle is a satirical news website, written by a bunch of nut jobs. It's not actual news, even though it may look like it to some people.. 

Q: How long can the Nokia 3310 actually run?
A: When you give up so many power hungry features, there's one major goal behind them: battery life. And here the new Nokia 3310 runs rings around every modern smartphone on the market:

Nokia 3310 (2000) - 900mAh removable battery, 2.5 - 4 hours talk time, 55 hours standby
Nokia 3310 (2017) - 1200mAh removable battery, 22 hours talk time, 31 days standby

Yes, the 2017 Nokia 3310 can last up to one month between charges, around 30x more than you'll get out of your iPhone 7 and Galaxy S8. You'll be able to go on a two week holiday and not even need to pack a charger, mindblowing by today's high powered smartphone standards..

Q: Does West Virginia position in the U.S national highway system affirms all the hard work by Governor Jim Justice on the states roads?
A: Justice has a point about the overall number, but his celebratory tone is somewhat exaggerated.

Evidence:

Q: Were there any 5g tests taking place around the time of the birds deaths?
A: This is not the case. 5G has not been tested in the vicinity of the park. (translated). 

Q: Were the birds tested to find the cause of death?
A: esearchers at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam and Wageningen University did autopsies on 15 of the starlings. From the birds’ internal injuries, the researchers concluded that they had probably died from hitting objects (possibly the ground, tree branches or each other) at great force.

The exact reason why the birds hit the objects is not known, but the university suggested that it may have been caused by panic due to a hunting owl or another disturbance.

The university confirmed that the official cause of death was bleeding as a result of trauma, but that tests also found traces of a toxin from the seeds of a berry starlings are known to eat. But it’s not known if the toxins played a part in their death..

Q: In the non business bankruptcy filings for the time period, were medical bills the sole cause of bankruptcy listed on 500,000 cases?
A: No. Bankruptcies typically involve multiple causes, and in some cases, medical bills may be a small piece of the pie. Sanders glosses over those nuances, stating that health-care costs drove people to bankruptcy in all 500,000 cases. The study he’s citing doesn’t establish that..

There is no mention of a more casual relationship in federal law. However, states have closed the gaps in federal law pertaining to people who commit misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence by enacting laws that prohibit domestic violence misdemeanors not covered by federal law from buying or possessing guns and/or ammunition. But, multiple states have no such law. 

Evidence:

Q: How does federal law define domestic violence?
A: the term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence” means an offense that—

Q: Does the gun prohibition in federal law apply to domestic violence committed in more casual boyfriend/girlfriend relationships or people who were merely dating?
A: No, there is no mention of a more casual relationship in federal law.. 

Q: Does state law exist that broadens the definition of domestic violence?
A: States have closed the gaps in federal law pertaining to people who commit misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence by enacting laws that:

Prohibit domestic violence misdemeanants not covered by federal law from buying or possessing guns and/or ammunition.
Authorize or require courts to order people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors to relinquish their guns and/or ammunition.

averitec_1837,Fact Check: Would Florida assault weapon law amendment proposal ban virtually all guns?,"Claim: Would Florida assault weapon law amendment proposal ban virtually all guns?

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Not all guns were banned in this proposal, only the defined assault weapons.

Evidence:

Q: What does the Florida gun law amendment propose?
A: BAWN’s proposal defines assault weapons more broadly than past definitions. Instead of listing design features to designate the banned weapons, the question describes assault weapons as “semiautomatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition at once, either in a fixed or detachable magazine, or any other ammunition-feeding device.” This definition expands on several existing state laws by including weapons that can accept large-capacity detachable magazines, which are typically what make assault weapons so lethal.

BAWN’s assault-weapons ban, which exempts military or law-enforcement members, would make possession of the defined weapons a third-degree felony. It would also give Floridians who already own these weapons a year to register them before their possession becomes illegal..

Justification: Police publicly addressed it as misinformation.

Evidence:

Q: Are the mass shooting messages spreading on Snapchat and iMessage after El Paso and Dayton based on credible information?
A: RUMOR ADDRESSED: Does this text message look familiar to you?

The Savanah Police Department has received word from some concerned citizens that this message is floating around through text message and on social media warning that a police officer claimed there could be shootings in Walmarts and are warning people not to go to these businesses. We are aware of the message, and after speaking with other law enforcement agencies we have learned that the message is floating around throughout the entire state and others as well. This message has not been determined to be a credible threat in the Savannah area, and appears to be the results of a wild internet rumor. Please be cautious of any social media rumors, and always bring them to law enforcement attention so that we can determine if there are any existing threats. Thank you to all who brought their concerns to the police department!. 

Q: What happened in the El Paso mass shooting?
A: Police in El Paso, a large city on the Mexico-US border, first received reports of gunshots at 10:39 local time (16:39 GMT) on Saturday.

A gunman had opened fire with an assault-style rifle in a crowded Walmart on the city's east side. Nearby businesses were placed on lockdown and shoppers were evacuated.

The store is near a retail park, the Cielo Vista Mall, which is popular with El Paso residents as well as shoppers from just across the Mexican border.

In addition to the 22 fatalities, 24 people were injured in the shooting. Eight Mexican nationals were among the dead and the victims' ages range from 15 to 90.

Officers arrived on the scene within six minutes and the attacker surrendered after he was confronted by police outside the store.. 

Q: What happened in the Dayton mass shooting?
A: Hours later, almost 1,600 miles away in Dayton, Ohio, shooting began at 01:07 local time (05:07 GMT) on Sunday in an area popular for its nightlife.

Security camera footage shows dozens of people racing through the doorway of the local Ned Peppers nightclub on E 5th Street. Nine people were killed and 27 were injured.

Just seconds later, the gunman is seen running towards the venue and being hit by police gunfire as he reaches the door. Police have confirmed they killed the gunman at the scene within 30 seconds of him opening fire.

Had the gunman made it through the door, Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl said, the loss of life would have been ""catastrophic"".

The suspect, 24-year-old Connor Betts, used a .223-calibre assault rifle with high-capacity magazines that he had ordered legally from Texas. There was nothing in his history that would have stopped him from buying the gun legally, police said..

Q: Did Obama pass legislation reforming the justice system?
A: Yes. President Obama signed a bill reducing the disparity in penalties for the use of crack and powder cocaine.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The source links present evidence that this claim is incorrect.

Evidence:

Q: Is an increase in use of psychiatric medications is causing an increase of violence?
A: The problem with the argument blaming medications,however, is that though there has been a signicant increase in the use of psychiatric medications, there has not been a corresponding increase in violence. In fact, just the opposite has occurred. Violent crime has decreased dramatically.. 

Q: How many shooters were on psychiatric medications — or coming off them — at the time of their attacks?
A: The following data is drawn from the sample of 48 shooters profiled in my book School Shooters: Understanding High School, College, and Adult Perpetrators. Out of 24 secondary school shooters, only two were taking medication at the time of their attacks: Eric Harris and Jeffrey Weise. Alvaro Castillo might have been, or he may have stopped his medication within three weeks of his attack and thus still have been coming off the drug. If we include him, then 12.5% of the sample was taking medications. Put differently, over 87% of the secondary school shooters were not on psychiatric medications at the time of their attacks. Furthermore, there is no evidence that medication made Harris, Weise, or Castillo manic or psychotic. The numbers are essentially the same for the college and adult shooters..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Evidence finds conflicting evidence, where one side showcases that wild-caught geckos may have different types of bacteria in their oral cavities than captive-hatched ones. The bacteria can be potentially dangerous bacteria, protozoa, or, rarely, a pathogenic fungus that can be transmitted to a human via a bite that punctures the skin. There was also a Salmonella outbreak in 16 states that was linked to pet geckos. On the other hand, it is said that geckos are non-toxic, do not bite, and are not known to transmit any kind of infection or disease to humans.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The Q&A Pair did not Specifically ask questions about the number (249 ) of mass shootings in United States, 2019 and many other countries. There is no direct source to refute or support the claim. 

Evidence:

Q: What is the definition of ""mass shooting"" in the US?
A: According to a Congressional Research Service report dated 18/03/2013:
There is no broadly agreed-to, specific conceptualization of this issue, so this report uses its own definition for public mass shootings. These are incidents occurring in relatively public places,
involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims
somewhat indiscriminately. The violence in these cases is not a means to an end—the gunmen do
not pursue criminal profit or kill in the name of terrorist ideologies, for example.. 

Q: How does US compare to the rest of the world in connection with mass shootings?
A: According to a research paper written by John R Lott, Crime Prevention Research Center dated  November 12, 2018:

The U.S. is well below the world average in terms of the number of mass public shootings, and the global increase over time has been much bigger than for the United States.

Over the 18 years from 1998 to 2015, our list contains 2,354 attacks and at least 4,880 shooters outside the United States and 53 attacks and 57 shooters within our country. By our count, the US makes up less than 1.15% of the mass public shooters, 1.49% of their murders, and 2.20% of their attacks. All these are much less than the US’s 4.6% share of the world population. Attacks in the US are not only less frequent than other countries, but they are also much less deadly on average.. 

Q: What does the updated version dated August 11, 2020 of this paper state?
A: The U.S. is well below the world average in terms of the number of mass public shootings, and the global increase over time has been much bigger than for the United States.

Over the 20 years from 1998 to 2017, our list contains 2,772 attacks and at least 5,764 shooters outside the United States and 62 attacks and 66 shooters within our country. By our count, the US makes up less than 1.13% of the mass public shooters, 1.77% of their murders, and 2.19% of their attacks. All these are much less than the US’s 4.6% share of the world population. Attacks in the US are not only less frequent than other countries, they are also much less deadly on average. Out of the 101 countries where we have identified mass public shootings occurring, the United States ranks 66th in the per capita frequency of these attacks and 56th in the murder rate..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There not exists a law that prevents the city of New York making an investigation if there is a federal investigation.

Evidence:

Q: Is there a law that prevents the city of New York making an investigation if there is a federal investigation?
A: No. De Blasio also said that it was a mistake for the city to wait for federal prosecutors to finish investigating Garner’s death before the police department began disciplinary proceedings. But there is no rule requiring the NYPD to do so.

Q: Did other journalists point out that there was no legal requirement for the city of New York to not investigate if there was a federal request?
A: Yes. Nolan Hicks of the New York Post tweeted: 'There was nothing that prevented the de Blasio administration legally from bringing the administrative charges against Daniel Pantaleo while waiting on the Justice Department. City Hall says they held off on the Justice Department's behest.'

A: The NYPD could have started those proceedings years ago. In fact, it did start that process well before the Justice Department closed its civil rights investigation this year with no charges. The NYPD’s delay had a material effect, because it meant more requirements for prosecutors seeking to prove Pantaleo’s culpability..

Q: What is a Brexit divorce bill?
A: In the financial settlement (the settlement), the UK and EU have set out how they will
settle their outstanding financial obligations to each other. The obligations arise out of the
UK’s participation in the EU Budget and broader aspects of its EU membership.
The settlement says which financial commitments will be covered, the methodology for
calculating the UK’s share and the payment schedule. The settlement is part of the
Withdrawal Agreement, which is the legally binding treaty setting out the negotiated
terms of the UK’s departure from the EU.
There is no definitive cost to the settlement. The final cost to the UK will depend on future
events such as future exchange rates and EU budgets. The Office for Budget Responsibility
estimate that the net cost to the UK may be £34 billion..

Justification: Mueller said “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.”
Clearly this is not ""full cooperation"".

Evidence:

Q: What was the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S presidential campaign called?
A: The Mueller Report.. 

Q: What is the Mueller Report?
A: The report is a summation of the findings from the special counsel investigation. It is expected to contain the details of the investigation, from its interviews with key witnesses and other evidence amassed throughout the process and the Mueller team’s conclusions – or lack thereof.

In a letter to lawmakers, Attorney General William Barr said the report “sets forth the Special Counsel’s findings, analysis and the reasons for his conclusions.” 

Mueller was appointed in May 2017 shortly after Trump fired Comey. Mueller was authorized to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election, whether any Trump associates coordinated or colluded with the Russians, whether Trump obstructed the investigation and any other crimes that were uncovered during the investigation.. 

Q: Did Donald Trump act in good faith when being investigated?
A: Trump consistently denied that he or anyone on his team colluded with Russia to interfere in the election, and he has rejected further the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia attempted to interfere in the election at all, including while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after Mueller’s appointment. He likewise denied the possibility he had obstructed justice.

Throughout the process, Trump railed against Mueller and Mueller’s team, accusing them of political bias and maligning both the intelligence community and Justice Department more broadly..

systematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In

that public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government—began that same month.

October and November.

A: The investigation established multiple links between Trump Campaign officials and
individuals tied to the Russian government. Those links included Russian offers of assistance to
the Campaign..

A: In some instances, the Campaign was receptive to the offer, while in other instances

averitec_1905,Fact Check: London is now one of the world’s most violent capital cities.,"Claim: London is now one of the world’s most violent capital cities.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the Q&A it seems that London is never mentioned in any of the lists of the most violent cities. So the claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: Which capital cities is the most violent cities in the world?
A: Venezuela's capital city of Caracas is and will be, until January of next year at least, considered the world's most violent city... except it isn't.

Mexican non-governmental organization (NGO) the Citizen's Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice (Consejo Ciudadano para la Seguridad Pública y la Justicia Penal – CCSPJP) has published its list of the world's 50 Most Violent Cities in 2015, which ranked Caracas number one.Since El Faro's Sala Negra was created five years ago, I have worked as a journalist who tries to understand violence indicators in El Salvador, and I like to compare them with what is happening in other countries in Latin America.

While international news agencies and prestigious media outlets elevate this Mexican NGO's list as absolute truth, we at Sala Negra dismissed it as a trusted source some two or three years ago. And we did it for one simple reason: in my opinion, the list's errors and superficiality are far too serious.. 

Q: Where are the world’s most violent capital cities ?
A: Murder is more common in Latin America than in any other part of the world.

That's the most striking takeaway from a ranking of the most violent cities compiled earlier this year by Mexico's Citizens' Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice. The ranking doesn't count deaths in war zones or cities with unavailable data.Thirty-four of the 50 worst cities were located in the region, including repeat murder capital of the world — San Pedro Sula, Honduras — which saw 187 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013 and is getting steadily worse. A full one-third of global homicides occur in Latin America even though the region has just 8% of the world's population, according to United Nations data.

Drug trafficking, gang wars, political instability, corruption, and poverty combine to cause the region's elevated violence.

US cities also made the list, led by Detroit at No. 24 and New Orleans at No. 26..

averitec_1933,Fact Check: kenya's forestry sector contributes 3.6% of the national gross domestic product.,"Claim: kenya's forestry sector contributes 3.6% of the national gross domestic product.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The source indicted that there was no sufficient evidence to prove that Kenya's forestry sector contributes 3.6% of the national gross domestic product. 

Evidence:

Q: Does the forestry sector in Kenya contributes 3.6% of GDP by 2019 ?
A: The FAO report estimated that the formal forestry sector made up 1.2% of GDP in 2011, from wages, profits and timber. When the informal sector such as woodfuel and charcoal was counted, forestry’s contribution rose to 3% – still lower than the taskforce’s estimate of 3.6%.
The report said the official figure, which put forestry’s GDP contribution at 1.1%, was a “gross underestimate”. This was by “at least 2.5%, which puts the estimate of its annual contribution to GDP to around 3.6%”.But their was no proof of the same. Hence, this claim is unproven.. 

Q: Are 60% of the national energy requirements in Kenya are from wood fuel by 2019 ?
A: But the Energy Regulatory Commission says biomass, including wood fuel, makes up 70% of Kenya’s energy supply. The FAO’s 2014 State of the World’s Forests puts this at 68%.This claim is true..

Microwave ovens produce non-ionizing radiation, which is like the radiation from your cell phone — though much stronger.

Keep in mind that light is also electromagnetic radiation, so clearly not all radiation is bad.

Microwave ovens have metal shields and metal screens over the window that prevent the radiation from leaving the oven, so there shouldn’t be any risk of harm..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The claim is correct.

A: Yes. In various countries campaigning is allowed up to the day of election. The United States of America has no uniform set of electoral rules for its states, yet, a popular rule amongst is that campaigning must be restricted in the polling place and its closest surroundings.

averitec_1951,Fact Check: Female soccer players in the U.S are earning less money than male players.,"Claim: Female soccer players in the U.S are earning less money than male players.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Q&A 1 explains that yes overall women soccer players are paid less as they bring lesser revenue. which is in agreement with the claims point.

Evidence:

Q: How much does the U.S Female soccer players earn compared to USMNT?
A: In March, every member of the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against the soccer federation for gender discrimination. It stipulates that currently, if each team played and won 20 exhibition games in a year, “female WNT players would earn a maximum of $99,000 or $4,950 per game, while similarly situated male MNT players would earn an average of $263,320 or $13,166 per game."" So the team is seeking equal treatment and pay, because as it stands, the women reportedly 38% of what their male counterparts make. As far as individual players' incomes, they can vary markedly based on sponsorships and star power. Goalie Ashlyn Harris told The New York Times that she expects to make “between $300,000 and $400,000” this year, and another player estimated $167,500. Alex Morgan is estimated to earn $1 million annually. But for players without endorsement deals and less celebrity status, the numbers can be a lot lower.Prior to the U.S. team's most recent landslide victory, Democratic presidential candidates Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren have long taken up the cause of equal pay in sports. The Paycheck Fairness Act, passed by House Democrats, would protect against gender discrimination, though it is currently stalled in the Senate. Notably, when asked by a reporter earlier this week if the women's team should be paid the same as the men, President Trump declined to respond.. 

Q: How much is Women's World Cup 2019 Prize Money ?
A: The 2019 World Cup championship team will win $4 million, and the total prize money awarded to all teams during this summer's World Cup is roughly $30 million. Both figures are double what the women's World Cup paid out to teams during the 2015 tournament in Canada. But let's compare those figures with the men's World Cup: In 2018, World Cup champion France was awarded $38 million by FIFA for winning the tournament, which is more than what all of the 2019 women's World Cup teams get combined. The prize money overall for the men's 2018 World Cup in Russia came to a total of $400 million, or over 13 times more than the FIFA prize money for the women this summer. What's more, members of the USA women's team earned bonuses of $90,000 for reaching the quarterfinals in the 2019 World Cup. If the U.S. men's team had reached the same point in last year's World Cup, they would have gotten bonuses of $550,000. This is the case even though the U.S. women's team outearns the men's team in revenues. The main argument for why the men's World Cup prize money totals are so much bigger than the women's counterpart is that men's soccer has far more interest among fans — and far higher revenues overall around the globe. The women's World Cup 2015 in Canada reportedly brought in $73 million in revenues, including some $17 million in TV ads just in the U.S. Those are actually tiny numbers compared to the $6 billion in revenues FIFA raked in during the 2018 men's World Cup in Russia.. 

Q: How Much Money U.S. Women's National Team Players Make ?
A: The U.S. women's national team fought for a raise, and got one in 2017, when players began receiving an undisclosed pay increase. Before then, members of the U.S. national team were paid ""a maximum of $4,950 per 'friendly,' or non-tournament, game that they won, while men’s national-team players earned an average of $13,166 for the same thing,"" according to The Atlantic. Yet even after the pay raise, America's female national team still makes significantly less than their male equivalents. This is the case even though the women have won three World Cups and four Olympic gold medals over the past two decades, compared to zero and zero for the U.S. men's team. Earlier this year, the U.S. women's team filed a lawsuit against U.S. Soccer, seeking better pay for women, who reportedly earn 38% of what their male counterparts make. Among other arguments U.S. Soccer attorneys have made to explain the gender pay differences are that the men's and women's national teams ""have separate collective bargaining agreements; and have separate budgets that take into account the different revenue that the teams generate."" While U.S. Soccer fights the women's national team lawsuit, sponsors have stepped up in the battle over equal pay. In early April, USWNT sponsor LUNA Bar made a donation that will give each member of the women's team $31,250 — which is the difference between the World Cup bonuses for America's men's and women's teams. Meanwhile, U.S. Soccer sponsor Visa says that under the terms of a new five-year deal more than 50% of its funding will go to the women's team, rather than a 50-50 split between men and women like in the past. And soccer branding titan Adidas says that it will pay equal bonuses to all of its sponsored players, male and female alike, for winning the World Cup. So how much money could U.S. women's national team players make if they win the World Cup 2019? It's difficult.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: All but eight Republicans rejected the bill

Evidence:

Q: what is the crime bill?
A: The 1994 crime bill, which Biden, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, largely wrote and shepherded through the legislative process. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 received bipartisan support at the time but has been criticized for some of its provisions, such as mandatory minimum sentencing, and its impact on mass incarceration. (When we looked at claims in 2016 from both sides on the law’s role in mass incarceration, we found the trend of increasing imprisonment began well before 1994, but experts told us the 1994 law exacerbated the issue.). 

Q: Did the republicans vote against the crime bill?
A: McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, did vote against the final version of the bill in August 1994, as did all but eight Republican senators. However, months earlier, in November 1993, the original bill had garnered near universal support in the Senate, with McConnell on the “yes” ledger.. 

Q: Why did they switch their vote?
A: they objected to additional spending in the final bill, calling it “pork.” McConnell told CNN on Aug. 15, 1994, 10 days before the final Senate vote: “The Kentucky Fraternal Order of Police this weekend came out against this crime bill. … [B]ecause they thought it was porked up, that it was going to be a bill basically about social workers and not police officers.”.

Evidence:

Q: Did the 1994 Crime Bill provide funding to divert drug users to a different court for sentencing?

A: Yes. Biden, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote and brought through  The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994

Q: Did the 1994 law say addicts should go to a separate court and not to prison system?
A: a March 2018 CRS report explains. “Many drug courts offer a treatment and social service alternative for those who otherwise may have faced traditional criminal sanctions for their offenses. In some drug courts, individuals that have been arrested are diverted from local courts into special judge-involved programs; these courts are often viewed as ‘second chance’ courts. Other drug court programs offer reentry assistance after an offender has served his or her sentence.”.

Justification: None of the evidence found comes to a conclusion on what the Republicans think about the Democrats removing the policy of mandatory minimums, it's safe to assume the Republicans did not agree with its removal by the Democracts but the QA didnt manage to discover any evidence backing that assumption.

Evidence:

Q: What legislation is being discussed?
A: The final legislation included a so-called “safety valve” provision that limited the use of mandatory minimum federal sentences for some drug offenses. A defendant could qualify to be exempt from those mandatory sentences if he or she met certain criteria, including: that the defendant didn’t use violence or possess a gun or dangerous weapon during the act, no one was killed or seriously injured, and the defendant wasn’t “an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense.”. 

Q: What is the three strikes rule?
A: Mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for Federal
offenders with three or more convictions for serious violent felonies or
drug trafficking crimes.. 

Q: What this supported by Biden?
A: Biden did not back the three strikes provision, but he did back a Republican amendment that was added to the Senate legislation. Biden is on record at the time as saying he supported a three-strikes provision for “serious [violent] felonies against a person,” but he was against including nonviolent offenses and expressed concern that minor crimes could get swept up in the measure..

averitec_1965,Fact Check: The EU has decided to increase the size of fisherman’s meshes.,"Claim: The EU has decided to increase the size of fisherman’s meshes.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The claim makes refernce to the EU deciding to chance the size of fishing net holes to increase their size, which as Q&A 1 states will result in less fish being caught.
Q&A 5 only shows that the EU wanted a minimum net size which is not an increase as claimed but could be for some fishermen depending.

Evidence:

Q: What is the relationship between mesh size and the fish that can be captured?
A: The size selectivity of most fishing gears can be changed by making changes to the mesh size. Bigger mesh gives the opportunity for more small fish to escape. This does depend on the smaller fish actually coming into close contact with the larger meshes.. 

Q: What was the EU commission change to mesh sizes at the time of the claim?
A: Vessels shall be prohibited from using any beam trawl with a mesh size between 32 and 99 mm north of a line joined by the following points by a point on the East Coast of the United Kingdom at latitude 55° N, then east to latitude 55°, longitude 5° E, then north to latitude 56° N and east to a point on the west coast of Denmark at latitude 56° N. It is prohibited to use any beam trawl of mesh size range 32 to 119 mm within ICES Division.. 

Q: Was the EU commissions change to mesh sizes around the time of the claim responsible for substantial financial losses in the fishing industry?
A: Aggressive fishing in the late 1950s saw an increase in landings, which started the collapse in catch numbers between 1965 and 1982 before mesh size regulations as part of EU Common Fisheries Policy (Cfp )..

Evidence:

Q: What changes did the EU make to fishermen's mesh net sizes?
A: '...mesh sizes are now minimum sizes and do not prevent fishermen from using larger mesh sizes if they want to.'. 

Q: Has this change in mesh size reduced fishermen's income by 40%?
A: ""Some claimed it could lose up to 40% of their income from just this one ruling"" but this comes from an unknown source cited in an interview in a Cornish news site.. 

Q: Did the EU's decision to increase the size of fisherman’s meshes will reduce the fisherman's income to 40% ?
A: The larger the mesh the easier it is for small fish to escape nets undamaged. 
EU regulation has changed and there is now a minimum mesh size in certain areas. That came in place on 1 July 2019.
The European Parliament and Council had two months to object to the delegated act on fishing regulations, but this didn’t happen so it is now law. It’s also now in UK law. The fishermen catching squid too and some claimed it could lose up to 40% of their income from just this one ruling but this hasnt been proved..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Standards are not meeting the required TEDS standards. 

Evidence:

Q: What meals are children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody receiving?
A: While all facilities had
infant formula, diapers, baby wipes, and juice and snacks for children, we
observed that two facilities had not provided children access to hot meals
— as is required by the TEDS standards — until the week we arrived.
Instead, the children were fed sandwiches and snacks for their meals.. 

Q: Do children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody have access to showers?
A: No. For example, children at three of
the five Border Patrol facilities we visited had no access to showers,
despite the TEDS standards requiring that “reasonable efforts” be made to
provide showers to children approaching 48 hours in detention. At these
facilities, children had limited access to a change of clothes; Border Patrol
had few spare clothes and no laundry facilities.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Both figures are incorrect. Even though one is only out by a few percentage points, the other one is hugely different. So it cant be said to be correct. 

Evidence:

Q: is the County Governments’ allocation of 6.7% of their total budgets to the agriculture sector just 3% less than the 10% recommended allocation for agriculture as per the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program ?
A: In 2018/19, agriculture’s share rose to KSh29.1 billion (6.3%) out of a total of KSh462.1 billion. A 10% allocation would have been KSh46.2 billion.

This works out to a difference of just over three percentage points. 

But the difference between the 2018/19 allocation of KSh29.1 billion and the Malabo aspiration of at least 10% of the total county budget (KSh46.2 billion) works out to a gap of 37%, not 3%..

One claim about agriculture was mostly correct, and the other incorrect. A third claim on revenue was also mostly correct, but a claim on healthcare budgets was incorrect.. 

Q: Did all Counties in Kenya allocate at least 20% of their budget to health care?
A: In 2017/18 at least five counties allocated less than 20%  to health. These were Kakamega (17.1%), Laikipia (13.4%), Taita Taveta (7.7%), Tana River (17.8%) and Turkana (11.6%).

And in 2018/19, nine counties allocated less than 20% of their budgets to health. These were Baringo (2%), Kakamega (13%), Laikipia (13%), Mandera (18%), Nyandarua (11%), Taita Taveta (7%), Tana River (19%), Turkana (11%) and Wajir (17%).

Justification: Evidence has found that both Amazon and Halliburton pay US taxes. However, there is a contradiction where the evidence has found that it's Amazon's second straight year owing no tax: In 2017, Amazon filed for a $137 million refund on $5.6 billion in profit. Hence, conflicting evidence.

Evidence:

Q: Does Amazon pay taxes
A: Amazon itself paid $957 million in income taxes worldwide in 2017, according to a regulatory filing.. 

Q: Does Halliburton pay tax
A: Halliburton annual/quarterly income after taxes history and growth rate from 2010 to 2022.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Answer support a drop in funding but not an immediate discontinuation which makes the further points of the claim invalid however there was an increase in attempted crossings.

Evidence:

Q: What aid program is being talked about here?
A: Biden was referring to the “U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America,” which began under Obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a June 12 report by the Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress. (See Table 5, page 13.). 

Q: How much had the program decreased before Trump was elected?
A: Appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began Oct. 1, 2016, before Trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.. 

Q: How much further did it reduce during Trump's administration?
A: From there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the CRS report. That’s a reduction of just under 23 percent.

Trump’s budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins Oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under Obama..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Evidence finds that there are 2,121,600 prisoners in U.S. prisons, not 2.3 million as the claim states. Evidence also finds that even though most Americans assume the figure is about 50%, somewhat fewer than 15% are incarcerated for drug offenses. Drug offenses are far more prevalent in the federal prison system, but that houses only about 10 percent of all prisoners; most incarcerated people are in state prison. Hence, the evidence is conflicting.

Evidence:

Q: What is the prison population of the USA?
A: 2 121 600. 

Q: How many of those are incarcerated for non-violent drug crime?
A: But the simple truth is that, at a minimum, 55 percent of those in state prison have been convicted of a violent crime — and more than half of these people, or nearly 30 percent of the total prison population, have been found guilty of murder, manslaughter, rape or sexual assault, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Slightly less than 15 percent are incarcerated for drug crimes, even though most Americans believe the figure to be about 50 percent. (Drugs play a bigger role in the federal prison system, but that holds only about 10 percent of all prisoners; most incarcerated people are in state prison.).

Justification: 2,500 drugs increased in price in 2018 when Trump is the president, according to the Centers for Medicare Services in the United States.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Not all of the 32million will be taken off their health care

Evidence:

Q: Where did the figure 32 million come from?
A: In 2017 the Congressional Budget Office estimated the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description,  would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years.. 

Q: Would all these people likely be thrown off their insurance?
A: No. not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. CBO said: “In the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.”

Q: Did Donald trump plan a bill that would throw people of their health plans?
A: Yes. He planned on removing an Obama health care bill nicknamed Obamacare but known as the affordable care act.

Q: How much of America's wealth is controlled by the top 1% wealthiest Americans?
A: The wealthiest 1 percent of American households own 40 percent of the country's wealth, according to a new paper by economist Edward N. Wolff.

averitec_2033,Fact Check: Number one reason for why American families go broke is the cost of healthcare,"Claim: Number one reason for why American families go broke is the cost of healthcare

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q7A 1 shows that contrary to what is claimed medical factors play a much smaller role in causing U.S. bankruptcies than has previously been claimed
Q&A 2 is also contrary to the claim showing that evidence on medical bankruptcy is built on the fallacy that when two things occur together there is necessarily a causal relationship between them. along with Q&A's 4 also not agreeing with the claim
However Q&A 5 shows that 60 percent of bankruptcies are linked to medical bills which conflicts with the other Q&A's so this is problematic for judging the claim.


Evidence:

Q: Is healthcare the number one reason for personal bankruptcy in America
A: Our findings suggest that medical factors play a much smaller role in causing U.S. bankruptcies than has previously been claimed. Overemphasizing 'medical bankruptcies' may distract from understanding the true nature of economic hardship arising from high-cost health problems,” wrote researchers of the 2018 study. 

Q: Can medical debt lead to personal bankruptcy
A: The fact that, according to a 2014 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, about 20% of Americans have substantial medical debt yet in a given year less than 1% of Americans file for personal bankruptcy suggests that this assumption is problematic. Clearly, many people face medical debt but do not go bankrupt. Even after correcting for overly broad definitions of “medical” expenses,3 the existing, widely cited evidence on medical bankruptcy is built on the fallacy that when two things occur together there is necessarily a causal relationship between them.. 

Q: Are medical bills the main reason why people in the United States file for bankruptcy?
A: A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018 indicated that while hospital costs had an impact on bankruptcy, they were frequently just one of many contributing factors.

Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it, some like Congressman O’Rourke have not.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Evidence shows section 1325 criminalises crossing the border, and that O'Rourke opposed appealing it, but the claim is worded badly and is a copied quote. 

Evidence:

Q: Does Section 1325 of the United States Code criminalize illegal entry into the country?
A: Yes. Section 1325 is the part of the United States Code that criminalizes illegal entry into the country as a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment or fines.

Q: Has Congressman O’Rourke opposed repealing the Section 1325 law?
A: Yes. Mr. O’Rourke has opposed repealing the law.

Q: What is Section 1325 of the United States Code ?
A: Section 1325 related to the punishment for illegal reentry to the UA. It states than an alien previously denied admission and removed,  shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both..

averitec_2037,Fact Check: The US-Iran nuclear deal pushed back a nuclear breakout by 10–20 years.,"Claim: The US-Iran nuclear deal pushed back a nuclear breakout by 10–20 years.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: It seems that a nuclear breakout is a bit big of a statement, therefore the evidence is conflicting. From the 3rd QA it is evident that the deal is in place to prevent Iran from chaning middle eastern politics. Therefore the label is conflicting evidence

Evidence:

Q: What is the US-Iran nuclear deal?
A: The Iran nuclear deal effectively shuts Iran’s pathways to nuclear weapons while preserving its legal right to civilian nuclear energy. The deal substantially lengthens the time Iran would need to enrich enough uranium for nuclear weapons, putting eyes on the program to detect any activity toward overt weaponization and drastically increasing the chance of detecting any so-called secret “sneakout.”. 

Q: Is the Iran nuclear deal delaying a nuclear breakout?
A: The deal extends the time Iran would need to produce an atomic bomb from two or
three months to at least one year, which would give the United States and its allies an
opportunity to react if the Iranians broke the agreement.. 

Q: Does the Iran nuclear deal limit Iran's ability to produce nuclear weapons?
A: It puts strong, verifiable limits on Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon for at least the next 10 to 15 years and is potentially one of the most consequential accords in recent diplomatic history, with the ability not just to keep
Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but also to reshape Middle East politics..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: There is a sufficient evidence supporting the 15 percent drops in suicides in states Connecticut, but none for 40 percent drops in gun violence. 

Evidence:

Q: When did the permit-to-purchase gun law pass in Connecticut?
A: In 1995, a permit-to-purchase handgun law went into effect in Connecticut, stating that people who want to buy a gun must apply for a license (or permit) with the local police, a process that involves a background check, as well as complete at least eight hours of gun safety training..

Justification: The evidence supports the fact that once Connecticut enacted a permit-to-purchase gun law, there was a 40 percent drop in gun violence and a 15 percent drop in suicides. Hence, the claim is supported.

Evidence:

A: Yes. Following Connecticut’s implementation of a licensing law, the state’s firearm homicide rate declined 40 percent and the firearm suicide rate declined 15.4 percent.[1]

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The 6th and 7th Q&A show conflicting evidence. One says 12.5% and one says 35% so the claim has conflicting evidence. Lots of the results are also unrelated to the claim.

Evidence:

Q: Did the Iran nucleur deal push back a nucleur breakout 10/20 yrs as claimed by Booker ?
A: “First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal,” Cory said. “And one of the reasons why we are seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us toward a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10-20 years, and now we see Iran threatening to go further and we are being pulled further and further into this crisis.. 

Q: Is Tim Ryan correct in saying that the bottom 60% of American households are not getting raises ?
A: This is incorrect. The bottom 60% have seen their income rise since 1980. 

It’s unclear where Ryan is pulling this statistic from, but a 2018 report from the Congressional Budget Office says that the bottom 60% saw an increase in household income of 32% -- adjusted for inflation -- from 1979 to 2015. 

Meanwhile the top 1% saw their income rise by 233%.. 

Q: Was Booker correct in saying that the private insurance overhead was 15 percent while Medicare’s was only at 2 percent ?
A: It’s true that the most recent Trustees Report of the Medicare system puts total “administrative expenses” at $9.9 billion last year. That’s actually 1.3 percent of total Medicare expenditures for the year — even less than the 2 percent figure Booker cited. So far, so good. Our conclusion: Booker and others using this and similar claims have a point — Medicare does spend less on administration than private insurers. But it’s not so simple as they would have you believe..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: There is no information as the when the Iran nuclear deal was made. There are conflicting answers regarding the impact. 

Evidence:

Q: Was there a nuclear deal with Iran?
A: Sen. Cory Booker claimed the Iran nuclear deal “pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.” The deal pushed back the breakout time from two or three months to one year for at least 10 years.. 

Q: How long did the Iran agreement delay the breakout time?
A: The deal extends the time Iran would need to produce an atomic bomb from two or
three months to at least one year, which would give the United States and its allies an
opportunity to react if the Iranians broke the agreement.. 

Q: What is the Iran agreement?
A: Known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, this deal:

Cuts off all of Iran’s pathways to a nuclear weapon, including a covert pathway

Puts in place vigorous, intrusive, and unprecedented
transparency measures that are necessary to verify that Iran cannot pursue a weapon

Ensures sanctions can be snapped back into place if Iran violates the deal.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q&A 4 states that the claim was made by the person as claimed in the claim, 
Q&A 1 states that Medicare's overhead is only 1.3% not 2 as claimed, (0.7%diffrence)
Q&A 3 shows that actually The definitions are incompatible and not reconcilable between the systems. so comparing Medicares overhead cost  to private health cares in this way is incorrect, with Q&A 3 listing good points why these figures are incompatible in the way claim shows.


Evidence:

Q: What were Medicare's admin expenses as a percentage of total expenses in 2018?
A: 1.3%. 

Q: How does the overhead charge for healthcare compare to the admin cost of healthcare?
A: Comparing data for the public Medicare with private Medicare, we show that the administrative expenses percentage of benefits for the public system is much lower.
The definitions are incompatible and not reconcilable between the systems.
We expand the focus to more financial data. Per-member income and benefits are larger for the public Medicare and grew faster than Medicare Part C, reversing earlier trends. The public Medicare is not solvent in many years, whereas the insurers’ Medicare has an 85% loss ratio.. 

Q: Are there other reasons that these numbers are incomparable.
A: Yes. Medicare beneficiaries are all age 65 or over, or disabled, and on average have much larger medical bills than the mostly under-65 population served by private health insurance. A 2006 study estimated that in 2003, the average medical cost for Medicare was $6,600 per person per year while the average medical cost for private health insurance (excluding out-of-pocket costs) was less than half that — $2,700 per person per year.

Justification: They have been punished as a consequence of court findings involving fines, probation and community service for employees.

Evidence:

Q: What consequences have Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin paid in light of the alleged connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths in the United States?
A: Purdue Pharma, the maker of Oxycontin, has settled with Oklahoma for $270 million after it was accused of fueling the nation's opioid epidemic;  the charges that Purdue deceptively marketed OxyContin would have been on full display in a state hit hard by the opioid crisis.. 

Q: As of the date of the claim have Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin faced criminal charges in light of the alleged connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths in the United States?
A: The company, Purdue Pharma, got five years probation and must pay the huge fines, and the three individuals involved - Michael Friedman, who is the former president; Howard Udell, who is the chief counsel; and Paul Goldenheim, the medical director, formerly - they all got three years probation and 400 hours of community service work.. 

Q: What is complete impunity?
A: Impunity means ""exemption from punishment or loss or escape from fines"".[1] In the international law of human rights, it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to justice and redress..

averitec_2051,Fact Check: Russia is not using illegitimate sanctions against Georgia.,"Claim: Russia is not using illegitimate sanctions against Georgia.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: the russian santions against georgia are not legal and authroised. 

Evidence:

Q: Is Russia using illegitimate sanctions against Georgia?
A: We have seen the Russian consumer-protection agency politicize trade and ban certain products when political relations with Russia deteriorate, not only in Georgia, but also in the Baltics, Moldova, Ukraine, and Central Asia,” Sergi Kapanadze, the Dean of the Caucasus School of Governance at the Caucasus University in Tbilisi wrote in a 2014 policy memo for the European Council on Foreign relations.. 

Q: What are the sanctions imposed by Russia against Georgia?
A: After the Rose Revolution brought Saakashvili to power in 2004, Moscow soon began applying energy sanctions to the recalcitrant Georgian leader. As with other defiant ex-Soviet states, Georgia was subjected to massive gas price increases. From 2004 to 2006 the price demanded by Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, increased by nearly 500 percent, from $50 to $235 per thousand cubic meters.19 Moscow tried to portray this as a ‘normal’ price increase, designed to bring Georgia in line with prices charged to Moscow's West European purchasers, which the Kremlin described as the “world market price.” Yet the political rationale was clear. First, price increases were targeted carefully to states which angered Moscow. Georgia, in fact, was treated the worst of any state—it was the first to be forced to pay full ‘Western’ prices, even ahead of Ukraine. Russia's most dramatic action, though, took place on January 22, 2006. Just days earlier it had stopped gas supplies to the Ukraine, allegedly over a pricing dispute. But it seemed that simply turning off the gas valves, even in midwinter, was not enough of a punishment for Georgia. Russia announced that both main gas lines to Georgia had been cut by bomb blasts, allegedly the work of Chechen separatists.23 Doubts were quickly raised. Why would Chechens target Georgia, a state which was at worst neutral in their dispute with Russia—and perhaps covertly a supporter, as Moscow alleged? Although it was never proven, many believed that Moscow had cut the lines deliberately, to weaken Saakashvili's government. Georgia suffered through a few days of closed schools and factories and freezing homes until gas service was restored.24. 

Q: What's meant by illigitimate sanctions?
A: Max Weber
famously defined political legitimacy as the de facto ability of a political regime to
secure acceptance based on belief (‘Legitimita¨tsglaube’) as opposed to securing compliance based on coercion alone.6 In ‘Reply to Habermas’ Rawls dismisses the sociological
or descriptive concept of political legitimacy associated with Weber as insufficient.7 Not
because he thinks that Weber is wrong to focus on de facto acceptance of political
authority, but because Rawls thinks that any sufficient definition of legitimacy would

have to acknowledge that there must be a benchmark of appropriate acceptance, or a
benchmark for when our belief that something is legitimate is appropriate. A full examination of political legitimacy must also ask whether
the agent who made the decision is authorized to make the decision, and whether the
decision has been made in accordance with established and recognized procedures that
are themselves appropriately authorized and sufficiently just..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: data shows 96% of asylum seeker show up for their court hearings. 

Evidence:

Q: What percentage of migrants show up to immigration court hearings, in the United States?
A: Data show that 96 percent of asylum applicants show up to all their immigration court hearings.. 

Q: Does the United States government provide defensive asylum seekers with appointed immigration lawyers?
A: Right to due process

What the law says: The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”

The issue of due process is at the heart of many immigration cases, including Reno v. Flores, the 1993 Supreme Court case that has returned to the spotlight with the surge in family separations. The case led to an agreement requiring the government to release children to their parents, a relative or a licensed program within 20 days.

In the ruling, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote “it is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.”

How it works in practice: Immigrants have the right to due process. But in reality, says, Andrew Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, “courts of law run the gamut.”

In some cases, immigrants are not granted a hearing at all. When asked about the president’s tweet, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed to the process of “expedited removal,” which was created by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.

“Just because you don’t see a judge doesn’t mean you aren’t receiving due process,” Sanders said.

Under the expedited removal process, immigrants who have been in the country illegally for less than two years and are apprehended within 100 miles of the border can be deported almost immediately without going through a court hearing.

The exception is asylum seekers, who must be granted a hearing.

Those who are not processed through expedited removal have the right to due process in an immigration court, where the main goal is to decide whether a person has a legal claim to remain in the U.S.

“In immigration court, you have very few rights,” said John Gihon, an immigration attorney who spent six years as a prosecutor for U.S. Immigration and Cust.

Justification: Evidence provided that Russian mercenaries are strongly linked to Russian state and that they are engaged in combat in Syria - this counters both claims.

Evidence:

Q: Have Russian mercenaries been engaged in combat in Syria?
A: Yes. The Russian mercenaries fighting in Syria say they are not in the country for the money or to help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Early last month, an unknown number of Russian mercenaries -- some reports say a dozen, others as many as 200 -- were killed by U.S. air strikes during fighting in Syria. The men were hired by a private military contracting firm called ChVK Vagner, which has been sending Russians to fight in Syria since 2015.

Q: Is ChVK Vagner sponsored by Russia?
A: Mark Galeotti, a researcher with the Institute of International Relations in Prague, has written extensively on the topic of Wagner and Russia’s use of mercenaries as a potentially deniable asset. According to him, Wagner cannot be considered a legitimate private military company.

“I tend to call Wagner a pseudo-mercenary outfit because it is somewhere in between,” Galeotti told Polygraph.info. “Given that it seems largely bankrolled through Evro Polis [a company owned by Prigozhin], and it has a contract with the Syrian government worth 25% of the output of any gas and oil fields it recovers, there is clearly some truly mercenary aspect, even if much of the time it is working for the Russian command cell in Damascus.”

But while he acknowledges a possible change in Wagner’s ownership, Galeotti agreed that the organization was undoubtedly tied to the Russian state, at least in the beginning: “I don't think there is any question they were originally a state-sponsored op, is there?”

And given the fact that wounded fighters still appear to be receiving treatment at Russian military hospitals, possibly arriving on Russian military transport aircraft, it appears that Russian authorities know far more about Wagner and its activities than they have so far admitted in public.. 

Q: Have any Russian mercenaries received state medals of the type usually awarded to military personnel?
A: Yes. According to Fontanka, Troshev (Wagners executive director) was awarded the Hero of Russia honor for assisting in the capture of Palmyra. Bogatov also reportedly won this title. Kuznetsov and Uktin have reportedly won the Order of Courage four times.

In both countries, 86% of residents believe corruption in the public sector is a very serious problem.

Mongolia has just 3.2 million residents, while Mexico, Nigeria and Russia are three of the largest countries on the globe, each with more than 100 million people. Based on the percentage of surveyed residents that reported corruption in the public sector is a very serious problem, these are the world's most corrupt nations.

Evidence:

Q: Was Buhari Administration substantially able cut down corruption in the past four years ?
A: Nigeria has a reputation for very massive corruption. I also know that the President (Buhari) has been able to cut that down very substantially. We talked about that, he is working on it and they have made a lot of progress and I think they will continue to make a lot of progress,” Trump said. Trump said this cut down on corruption in Nigeria will attract investors from the US to Nigeria. We have a lot of people in this country that invests in Nigeria, so cutting down on that corruption element and a corrupt element is very important to us and the President (Buhari) will be able to do that,” he added.

He also recognised Nigeria’s effort in its fight against terrorism and promised to support the country in that regard.

“Nigeria is one of the first African nation to join the coalition to defeat ISIS and Nigerian forces are currently leading regional efforts to defeat ISIS in West Africa and doing very well as we have. Nigeria is also leading Africa in the fight against Boko Haram,” he said.. 

Q: How many Nigerian have been convicted of corruption since President Buhari took office ?
A: In the three years that I have been in charge of EFCC, we have secured 703 convictions. For me, it was an auspicious opportunity to contribute my quota to Mr President’s vision of a corruption-free nation. The opportunity to fully subscribe to President Buhari’s mantra to `kill corruption before it kills us’, was for me, the highest call to duty – one that required absolute commitment and passion.

“Indeed, the task of fighting corruption in Nigeria has never been, is not and can never be an easy one,” he said.

He said that in 2015, ”there were 103 convictions; in 2016, 194 convictions; in 2017, 189 were secured while 217 convictions were secured from January, 2018 until date”. 

Q: What is Nigeria's Ranking on Corruption Perception Index (CPI) for 2018 ?
A: The Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Transparency International Chapter in Nigeria, said in a Tuesday morning statement to PREMIUM TIMES that “Nigeria scored 27 out of 100 points in the 2018 CPI, maintaining the same score as in the 2017 CPI.” In the country comparison, Nigeria ranks 144 out of 180 countries this year as opposed to 148 out of 180 countries in the 2017 CPI, the group added. Nigeria is thus still perceived as highly corrupt, and although the ranking shows that Nigeria moved up four (4) places, it only means that four other countries have scored worse while Nigeria stagnated..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Numbers suggest far lower number.

Evidence:

Q: What are the worldwide proceeds from drugs estimated to be?
A: If only flows related to drug trafficking and other
transnational organized crime activities were considered, related proceeds would have been equivalent to
around US$650 billion per year in the first decade
of the new millennium, equivalent to 1.5% of global
GDP or US$870 billion in 2009 assuming that the
proportions remained unchanged. The funds available
for laundering through the financial system would
have been equivalent to some 1% of global GDP or
US$580 billion in 2009.. 

Q: Does the UN have estimates for Mexican drug cartels?
A: Calculating trafficking profits to North America (total
transit profits of US5.3 bn) is relatively straightforward.
The largest part of these profits are generated by South
American groups, notably groups from Colombia (most
of the US$3.3 bn in profits generated in shipping the
cocaine to Mexico), followed by profits made by Mexican drug cartels (US$2 bn for shipping the cocaine
across the border to the USA; far more money is then
made by the Mexican drug cartels within the United
States in trafficking the cocaine to the various wholesalers and retailers)..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: From the answers and sources the claim is half right as people can buy firearms on the internet but there are regulations in place. 

Evidence:

Q: What are the regulations on the sale of weapons in the US?
A: There are about 300 federal and state gun laws that regulate the sale and acquisition of firearms in the United States. When it comes to internet gun sales, the firearm is sent to a gun dealer who holds a federal firearms license. An FBI background check is then conducted before the firearm is transferred to the buyer.. 

Q: Can firearms be sold on the internet in the US?
A: Yes. Potential gun buyers can view firearm advertisements and make
purchases from the following categories of websites: major retailers,
online retailers, online auctions and marketplaces, online classified
listings, online forums and social media networks, and Dark Web
websites.

Q: Who can buy a machine gun in the US?
A: Contrary to popular belief, it is perfectly legal for a law-abiding American citizen to own/possess a machine gun (sometimes called a full-auto firearm or automatic weapon).

The absolute easiest way is for someone to get a Federal Firearms License or “FFL” (even a home-based FFL).

Depending on the type of FFL, the FFL-holder can purchase and sell machine guns, regardless of when they were made (more on this below), and they can even legally make their own machine guns or lawfully convert current firearms into full-autos..

Q: What is Drug Abuse Resistance Education?
A: D.A.R.E. IS SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION EDUCATION AND MUCH MORE!

This year millions of school children around the world will benefit from D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education), the highly acclaimed program that gives kids the skills they need to avoid involvement in drugs, gangs, and violence.

D.A.R.E. was founded in 1983 and has proven so successful that it has been implemented in thousands of schools throughout the United States and many other countries.

D.A.R.E. is a police officer-led series of classroom lessons that teaches children from kindergarten through 12th grade how to resist peer pressure and live productive drug and violence-free lives..

A: A gateway drug is a drug that opens the door to the use of other, harder drugs. Gateway drugs are typically inexpensive and readily available.. 

Q: Has DARE changed their belief about cannabis being a gateway drug?
A: No. Frank Pegueros, DARE America’s president and CEO, tells me the organization’s position on that question has not changed. He says the confusion is “based on what appears to have been a partial posting of a document on our website.” The part that was posted (which has since been removed) discussed alcohol and tobacco as gateway drugs; the part discussing marijuana as a gateway drug was on a subsequent page that was not posted. “It’s obvious from looking at the document that the entire document was in fact not posted, because it only addressed tobacco and alcohol,” Pegueros says. “It didn’t address marijuana or inhalants, the typical substances considered to be gateway drugs.

Evidence:

Q: Does Russian law prohibit political activity in schools?
A: No answer could be found..

averitec_2166,Fact Check: Joe Biden improperly used his influence as vice president to get Ukraine to sack...,"Claim: Joe Biden improperly used his influence as vice president to get Ukraine to sack its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, to benefit his son Hunter Biden in 2016

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The evidence shows that Joe Biden didn't interfere in this matter.

Evidence:

Q: Did Biden threaten to withhold the $1 billion in loan guarantees to unseat Ukraine’s top prosecutor ?
A: Now, that prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, says he was fired because he was pursuing Zlochevsky and Burisma. “I didn’t get the hints that we should stop the investigation of Burisma wrongdoing,” he said in an interview published this week, in which he also accuses Biden of pursuing “personal interests” in Ukraine and recruiting Ukrainian officials to protect them — charges Biden denies. Shokin’s claims are highly questionable. The illegal enrichment and money laundering investigation against Zlochevsky was started in August 2014 at the request of Shokin’s deputy, Vitaly Kasko. He had a strained relationship with his boss, and resigned in early 2016, two months before Shokin’s firing. Shokin didn’t actually lead the Zlochevsky investigation, so his removal wasn’t necessary to stop it. Besides, Kasko denies there was any U.S. pressure to end the investigation: He told Bloomberg News that the case had been dormant for a while when Shokin was fired.. 

Q: Was The vice president’s trip in March 2016, to Ukraine connected to  Ukraine's sack of its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin ?
A: Ukraine’s prosecutor general said in an interview that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son, despite a swirl of allegations by President Donald Trump’s lawyer.. 

Q: Did the The U.S. plan to push for Viktor Shokin’s dismissal  initially  come from Joe Biden ?
A: The U.S. plan to push for Shokin’s dismissal didn’t initially come from Biden, but rather filtered up from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Embassy personnel had called for U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine to be tied to broader anti-corruption efforts, including Shokin’s dismissal, this person said..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: No evidence shows that The Chinese government put millions of dollars into Biden's family business.

Evidence:

Q: What is the claim referring to?
A: In the deal alluded to by Mr. Trump in the Fox News interview on Sunday, Hunter Biden and a business partner, Devon Archer, were involved in a fund that reportedly pursued an investment from the Chinese government-owned Bank of China.

The fund was announced in late 2013 — days after Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew to China from Japan aboard Air Force Two with the vice president, who was in the midst of a diplomatic mission intended to calm rising tensions in the region. During the trip, Vice President Biden warned Chinese leaders not to use fighter jets to enforce an air defense zone created by Beijing over contested waters.

The conservative author Peter Schweizer has suggested that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China — a suggestion that has been echoed by Mr. Trump’s allies in the conservative news media.. 

Q: Did Hunter Biden make any money from the deal?
A: a lawyer for Hunter Biden said he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip, and was not an equity owner in the fund while his father was vice president. He later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity that oversees the fund, but to date has not received any money from the arrangement, according to the lawyer..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The 1st Q&A pair point out that tariffs are paid by the US consumer when buying products from the tariffed country (china) not as is claimed that tariffs are paid by china to the us gov.
The 3rd Q&A pair does giv figures on these tarifs but they are substantially lower than what is claimed overall so as no parts of the claim are proved true then refuted has been chosen.


Evidence:

Q: Were China’s tariffs paid to the United States  by China?
A: Tariffs are a tax paid by American companies and consumers — not by the foreign governments targeted by the tariffs.. 

Q: How much did the Trump’s tariffs really cost Americans?
A: If American technology companies cannot export to China, they would only create next competitors there, while losing access to a huge market.. 

Q: Did More Trump Tariffs Hamper China’s Development
A: It is widely expected that these tariffs have thus far added more than one or two billion dollars in fiscal revenue to US government coffers. President Trump is complacent and self-congratulatory. However, the 10% tariff increase from the previous round seems to have been paid by American companies and consumers! US importers must see their profits eroded by tariffs if they do not directly pass these costs onto US companies downstream. A study by a group of economists from Princeton, Columbia, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that US companies have suffered a loss of $1.4 billion due to tariffs, while American consumers have footed the bill for more than $3 billion. Another study by another group of economists from the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation argues that the US-China trade war has cost the American economy $6.4 billion, equivalent to 0.03% of GDP. It seems unwise to let American companies and consumers take such large losses for such little increase in fiscal revenue..

A: The funding Poland gets from the EU budget goes to specific schemes such as  supporting agriculture, infrastructure or economic development.. 

Q: Is there evidence that the EU contributes to Poland's pension fund?

Evidence:

Q: Did a study reveal children get most of their genes from their maternal grandmother?
A: No, the study quoted in the claim is 
""Grandma plays favourites: X-chromosome relatedness and sex-specific childhood mortality""

They were trying to see if there was an effect if a grandparent with more or less certainty of having provided the X or Y chromosome of the kid was present or not.. 

Q: Where does a child get his/her DNA from
A: Your DNA contains a record of your ancestors, but you aren't a carbon copy of any one of them. The particular mix of DNA you inherit is unique to you.

Q: Did Russia use pencils aboard their early space flights?
A: The crafty Russians used a pencil.. 

Q: What is the Fisher's Space Pen?
A: In 1953 Paul Fisher invented the ""Universal Refill"" which could be used in most pens. Not content, Paul continued to work on making a better refill. After much experimentation he perfected a refill using thixotropic ink-semisolid until the shearing action of the rolling ball liquefied it-that would flow only when needed. The cartridge was pressurized with nitrogen so that it didn't rely on gravity to make it work. It was dependable in freezing cold and desert heat. It could also write underwater and upside down. The trick was to have the ink flow when you wanted it to, and not to flow the rest of the time, a problem Fisher solved. Fisher's development couldn't have come at a more opportune time. The space race was on, and the astronauts involved in the Mercury and Gemini missions had been using pencils to take notes in space since standard ball points did not work in zero gravity. The Fisher cartridge did work in the weightlessness of outer space and the astronauts, beginning with the October, 1968 Apollo 7 mission began using the Fisher AG-7 Space Pen and cartridge developed in 1966..

This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Study quoted in question 3 says the opposite has happened.

Evidence:

Q: What tariffs is Donald Trump talking about?
A: On September 24th 2018, the United States introduced import tariffs on a wide range of
Chinese products. The tariffs will affect US imports from China with a value that exceeds
USD 250 billion -around 50% of all imports. 

Q: What study is Trump quoting here?
A: Trump is quoting from a study by European economists that predicted that a 25-percentage-point increase in tariffs raises U.S. consumer prices on all affected Chinese products by only 4.5 percent on average, while the producer price of Chinese firms declines by 20.5 percent. 

Q: Is this backed up by other sources?
A: No. The study was released in November, using previously released studies from the 1990s, not actual data on prices. But a paper published March 2, by three prominent U.S. economists, found exactly the opposite had happened when actual trade data was studied.

averitec_2197,Fact Check: China hurts U.S. farmers by not buying their produce.,"Claim: China hurts U.S. farmers by not buying their produce.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: According to the sources, because of the huge tariffs imposed on China by USA, China no longer buy the produce of US farmers 

Evidence:

Q: Why did China stop purchasing produce from the United States?
A: President Trump's initial round of tariffs led China to strike back and stop purchasing from the United States.. 

Q: What tariff did President Trump impose on China?
A: So far, the US has slapped tariffs on US$550 billion worth of Chinese products.. 

Q: How will U.S. farmers be affected by the tariffs imposed on China by the United States?
A: U.S. farmers and
ranchers have a strong interest in maintaining and
expanding export markets. Because of the broad scope of
farm products subject to the retaliatory tariffs from China
and other countries and the importance of some of the
markets involved, many farmers and ranchers are likely to
experience some negative effects, such as lost market
opportunities and potentially lower prices for their products.
While the Administration has released the trade aid package
to mitigate short-term losses to farmers and ranchers, it is
not designed to address potential longer-term negative
consequences, such as lower commodity prices and reduced
farm income from lost export sales..

Justification: The Joe Biden proposed  bill was rejected and it was opposed by a majority of both parties.   

Evidence:

Q: Has Joe Biden made attempts to cut social security and Medicare?
A: Biden proposed a pause on all spending to help federal budget deficits. This was rejected and it was opposed by a majority of both parties.. 

Q: Did Biden promise other people's benefits to illegal immigrants?
A: No. The executive actions would have an effect on social security, but it is calculated on an individual basis. Nobody would receive benefits until they were legal, as documented in the Homeland Security document - 'For 
2024, we estimate that the additional number of individuals receiving a benefit from Social 
Security as a result of the 2014 executive actions will be just 16,000, increasing the total number 
of beneficiaries by 0.02 percent. By 2050, we project the increase in beneficiaries due to the 
executive actions will rise to about 0.76 percent, and will decline thereafter as the affected 
populations age.'

Q: Was there a recorded attempt by Biden to cut social security and medicare

averitec_2201,Fact Check: US President Donald Trump says four hundred miles of wall are getting built alon...,"Claim: US President Donald Trump says four hundred miles of wall are getting built along the US-Mexico border.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Based on the statistics provided in the QA pairs, less than 400 miles of wall are getting built under the administration of Trump.

Evidence:

Q: How many miles of border wall did Trump build?
A: Officials say the construction starting in February is only part of the picture. Funding from fiscal year 2018, they say, also covers the cost of building 70 more miles of barriers – about 57 miles of which is replacement fencing.

And if the Trump administration’s proposal for $5.7 billion more for a border wall is approved, officials say they’ll be able to build 234 miles of new and replacement barriers – about 100 miles of which will cover parts of the border that didn’t have a barrier before.

But given that a partial government shutdown over the wall is already in its fifth week, whether that work will happen – and exactly what will happen next – is anybody’s guess.. 

Q: Is there a construction of  four hundred miles of wall by Trump on the  Mexico border ?
A: A few prototypes were built in 2017, and over 100 miles of existing barriers have been, or are slated to be, repaired or replaced.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said about 205 miles of new and replacement barriers have been funded since January 2017, and as of May 23, work had been completed on 42 miles of replacement fencing in California, Texas and Arizona.

A few prototypes with different designs were built in San Diego in 2017 and tested, but they have been demolished to make way for fencing. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said the prototypes could “inform future border wall design standards in some capacity.”. 

Q: How much did Trump's border wall cost?
A: President Donald Trump’s “wall” along the U.S.-Mexico border would be a series of fences and walls that would cost as much as $21.6 billion, and take more than three years to construct, based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security internal report seen by Reuters on Thursday..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It is not banned, but no foreign law can not be used in state courts.

Many people, including Muslims, misunderstand Sharia. It's often associated with the amputation of limbs, death by stoning, lashes and other medieval punishments. Because of this, it is sometimes thought of as draconian. Some people in the West view Sharia as archaic and unfair social ideas that are imposed upon people who live in Sharia-controlled countires..

Q: In what context did India's Congress President Rahul Gandhi say he made the statement: Chowkidar Chor Hai?
A: On 10.04.2019, at the time of and in my statement, the issues relating to court proceedings unfortunately got juxtaposed and mingled with a political slogan being used extensively by answering Respondent's party as well as answering Respondent for the last several months, which is a matter of intense and frenzied public debate during the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. That slogan is ""Chowkidar Chor Hai"".. 

Q: What did India's Congress President Rahul Gandhi apologise to the Supreme Court for?

averitec_2250,Fact Check: Elizabeth Warren says she warned about the financial crisis before it happened,"Claim: Elizabeth Warren says she warned about the financial crisis before it happened

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Supported via multiple QA pairs.

Evidence:

Q: When did Elizabeth Warren warn about the crisis of the 2000s
A: In January 2007, she testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and  Urban Affairs about how the housing market was broken and could hurt consumers. 

Q: Which factors help cause the financial crisis of the 2000s
A: In the fall of 2008, our economy faced challenges on a scale not seen since the Great Depression. The crisis was caused by many factors. Among them were an unsustainable housing boom fueled in part by the easy availability of mortgages, financial institutions taking on too much risk, and the rapid growth of the nation’s financial system with regulations that were designed for a different era. Forces built up over many years until the crisis reached its apex in September of 2008.. 

Q: Did Elizabeth Warren warn against the financial crisis?
A: Yes. In a New York Times article in October 2005, the article said, ""Professor Warren of Harvard believes that disaster lurks as homeowners borrow against their homes to forestall bankruptcy. When the stock market tumbled five years ago, people in trouble could sell stocks to stay afloat, she said. But home equity doesn't work the same way. As she put it, ""You can't sell a part of your home like you could a stock in the stock market bubble.""

Justification: The question is too closely related to the claim, therefore it is quite biased. it seems from the answer, that the cells will not be weakened by vaccination. These two events are independent. Therefore, the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: With repeated use of vaccines, does the cell-mediated immunity weakens, encouraging viral mutations, and future infections of the cells?
A: Vaccination protects people from natural infection mainly by stimulating the humoral immune response and establishing immunological memory against a specific pathogen. This enables the body to respond swiftly and effectively upon encountering a natural infection by that pathogen in future. However, this does not come at the expense of cell-mediated immunity, which remains robust and active after vaccination..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The source in the first answer shows that 3 263 331 were built in 24 years so the claim is refuted as the number is below 4 million. 24 years is not classed as recently either.

Evidence:

Q: How many houses has the South African Government delivered in South Africa ?
A: 1. 2018/19 figures are for 9 months only (April to Dec 2018) and are preliminary;
2. EEDBS* (or DBS): Enhanced Extended Discount Benefit Scheme refers to the Housing Programme
that provides state subsidies to repair / rehabilitate and even demolish & re‐build where necessary,
Govt (rental) houses built before 1994 and then transfer houses into the ownership of legitimate occupants.
3. In some years, such as 2014/15, 2016/17 and 2017/18, the numbers for EEDBS were removed after
verification processes from the figure for Units as they are to be counted only under the EEDBS programme.
4. Twenty Year totals are still: Serviced Sites Houses/ Units Total H/O
903 543 2 835 275 3 738 818. 

Q: How many people own property in South Africa ?
A: Between 2002 and 2015, the percentage of households that lived in formal dwellings and whose dwellings
were fully owned increased from 52,9% to 53,8% while the percentage of partially owned dwellings
declined from 15,5% to 9,7%. About 13,6% of households had ‘other’ forms of tenure arrangements in
2015.
More than three-quarters (78,1%) of South African households lived in formal dwellings, followed by 14,1%
who lived in informal dwellings, and 6,9% in traditional dwellings. The highest concentration of households
in Limpopo (90,5%) lived in formal dwellings, followed by the households in Northern Cape (86,1%). The
highest percentage of informal dwellings were found in North West (22%) and Gauteng (21%).
At the time of the survey, 14,4% of South African households were living in ‘RDP’ or state-subsidised
dwellings. A higher percentage of female-headed (18%) than male-headed households (12%) received a
government housing subsidy. Some residents have, however, raised concerns about the quality of
subsidised houses and 14,2% said that the walls were weak or very weak while 13,8% regarded the
dwellings’ roofs as weak or very weak..

averitec_2256,Fact Check: People catching and spreading chickenpox have been vaccinated.,"Claim: People catching and spreading chickenpox have been vaccinated.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: This claim has cherry picked evidence. According to the QA pairs, it is possible to get chickenpox after being vaccinated as it has a 97% efficency rate (3% chance). It also seems that the vaccination helped lessen side effects of chickenpox if caught, e.g. deaths among those 50 years old and younger, decreased by 75% or more. This claim is true in the fact that people can catch and spread chickenpox despite being vaccinated, however a lot of positive factors are left out of the claim. Therefore, this claim was cherry-picked evidence.

Evidence:

Q: Can you catch chicken pox after vaccination?
A: Yes. A case-control study conducted from 1997 to 2003 showed that 1 dose of vaccine was 97% effective in the first year after vaccination and 86% effective in the second year. From the second to eighth year after vaccination, the vaccine effectiveness remained stable at 81 to 86%.

Q: After the vaccine for chickenpox rolled out did cases drop?
A: Yes. From 1995 to 2001, chickenpox hospitalizations declined by 72 percent and deaths, among those 50 years old and younger, decreased by 75% or more.

Justification: Ramaphosa does promise to built 1 million houses but across the whole country not in Alexandra. 

Evidence:

Q: Has President Ramaphosa promised to build 1 million houses in Alex?
A: The million houses issue in Alex is a huge distortion. The ANC government intends to build 1 million over the next 5 years throughout the country. Every province will be given a target that they must meet. This is something that I would like to see and it is possible.. 

Q: Has the South African government ever delivered 1 million housing units within 5 years?
A: Looking within 1994/95 to 1998/99, 1999/2000 to 2003/04, 2004/05 to 2008/09, 2009/10 to 2013/14 and 2014/15 to 2018/19*. None of the five consecutive years have seen the construction of one million housing units.

Justification: The US Border Patrol figures show many more than 1,671 deaths but it's unclear how this relates to ""dead bodies recovered"".

Evidence:

Q: How many instances were there of a baby born alive after abortion between 2003 and 2014?
A: 143 infants. 

Q: How many infant death certificates in the US mention abortion/termination of pregnancy?
A: Infant deaths for the 12 year period 2003 – 2014 assigned to code ICD-10 code P96.4 – Termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn were reviewed.
143 (24.3%) could definitively be classified as involving an induced termination. 

Q: Does the US collects data on abortions?

averitec_2261,Fact Check: Bumblebee has officially been added to the ever-growing list of endangered speci...,"Claim: Bumblebee has officially been added to the ever-growing list of endangered species

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Q&A 1 shows that yes the Bumblebee was added to the list of endangered species as claimed. But although only a single certain species of bumblebee  not all 'bumblebees' but the claim only says bumblebee not all, so it is supportive enough.

Evidence:

Q: Is the bumblebee an endangered species?
A: Yes. On January 11, 2017, the Fish and Wildlife Service published a rule to list the rusty patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis), a species that occurs in the eastern and Midwestern United States and Ontario, Canada, as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The rule was to be effective on February 10, 2017.

Q: When is a species considered as endangered?
A: The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct. Multiple factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.[4] The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.[5]

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.[6] Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans.. 

Q: What role do bees play in the ecosystem?
A: More than 75 percent of the world's food crops rely to some extent on pollination for yield and quality. The absence of bees and other pollinators would wipe out coffee, apples, almonds, tomatoes and cocoa, to name just a few of the crops that rely on pollination.
 
""Each one of us has an individual responsibility towards protecting bees and we should all make pollinator-friendly choices. Even growing flowers at home to feed bees contributes to this effort,"" Graziano da Silva said.

Pollinators, such as bees, wild bees, birds, bats, butterflies and beetles fly, hop and crawl over flowers to help plants fertilize. Pollinator numbers and diversity have declined in the past decades, and evidence indicates that the decline is primarily a consequence of human activities including climate change which can disrupt flowering seasons..

averitec_2288,Fact Check: The Kenyan law states that if you are allocated a piece of land you must develop...,"Claim: The Kenyan law states that if you are allocated a piece of land you must develop it within two years or it reverts to the government.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The claim states that when someone in Kenya is given land from the government they must develop that land within 2 years, Q&A pair 2 confirms that the government of Kenya does give out land and Q&A 3 states that is must be developed within 2 years or revert back to the government ( although this is rarely implemented it says) but still true.

Evidence:

Q: What act regulates the allocation of public land?
A: The Land Act sets out how public land can be allocated to private individuals, businesses and foreign governments.

“Where the land allocated … is not developed in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the lease, that land shall automatically revert back to the national or county government, as the case may be,” the law says.. 

Q: Must the land allocated, be developed?
A: Yes. “The presumption is that when you are given [public] land you must put it into good use as stipulated in the lease agreement. That is what guides the transaction,” David Mufuayia of land rights lobby the Kenya Land Alliance told Africa Check.

For example, public land provided under the export processing zone law must be developed within two years.

Q: Is this always applied across the board?
A: No. it is not always this clear cut. “It is very difficult to apply [the two-year-rule] across the board, because the land is normally leased specific to the use,” said Ibrahim Mwathane, chair of the Land Development and Governance Institute.

“The government would normally attach a whole lot of conditions on a lease, and one would need to look at those conditions and decide whether they have been complied with or contravened.” Mwathane is also a columnist on land issues for the country’s Daily Nation newspaper.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is evidence given that African-American woman have been sterilised it also shows that asian and hispanic woman were included in the counts. This appears to be happening illegally, a law in the 1970s made it illegal to pressure anyone to be sterilised or ask for it during labor and childbirth, as evidence has been found that doctors are still operating without consent from the state then one should probably assume that if that is the case the state has not given directives for it to happen and therefore it’s untrue that the official reason would be to cut welfare costs in California.

A: If they have been tested and approved for towing, electric cars actually excel at pulling heavy loads, with instant torque, powerful acceleration and smooth power output making them a great choice for towing caravans and trailers.. 

Q: which electric car has been approved for towing
A: At the moment, the only fully-electric car on the market that can tow is the Tesla Model X, which has been developed to make it as capable as any other SUV. With a 2,700kg towing weight, the Model X can tow heavy caravans, but you should know that the quoted 270-mile range will be affected by towing heavy loads.. 

Q: Are there plenty of vehicles that have a high towing capacity?
A: Electric motors are also increasingly being used in shipping, again because of their ability to push large loads.

For over a decade electric motors have been used in mining trucks, sometimes with a capacity greater than 100 tonnes, due to their powerful, instant torque and ability to pull large loads at slow speeds..

Q: Why was there a visa restriction on Nigerians ?
A: Last month, the government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) imposed visa restrictions on Nigerians; according to the new policy, only Nigerians who are 40 years and above can travel to the UAE for business, tourism or any other private visit.

Before now, young Nigerians troop to UAE, particularly Dubai for different purposes.
Some go their to relax; some travel there just because they want to have their previously-unstamped international passports stamped; some travel there for business, among others. It is even not uncommon to find a group of friends fixing Dubai as the destination of their next social gathering.

Our politicians also have choice properties in this Arab state, but with the new immigration policy, only people who are 40 years and above can visit the UAE now, although the authorities gave certain conditions for people who are less than 40 years old who want to visit.

When I first heard of this new policy, I knew Nigerians have ‘spoilt’ this Arab country as well.
In 1988, I was travelling to India and had a stop-over in Dubai; the place was nothing to write home at that time, but now, less than 30 years later, Nigerians of all ages troop to Dubai for different purposes. It is just so unfortunate that while we have regressed, they have progressed.

Why have our leaders chosen to enrich themselves only at the expense of the people?; Why have we failed to develop? Where are all the money we have made selling oil, and yet cannot boast more than $30billion in foreign reserves?

We will continue to be treated with disdain in other parts of the world if we don’t develop our country.
Other countries will never respect us if we cant live in our country, and instead prefer to travel for greener pastures outside.
It is so painful today seeing Nigerians in even less-developed countries ekeing out a living.
I hope we can wake up on time before we experience more foreign insults.

Ilorin, Kwara state.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Confirmed as a requirement since the 1910s in QA pair.

Evidence:

Q: Are US senators involved in the circuit court judicial nominees process
A: . After a President selects a nominee for a U.S. circuit or district court 
judgeship, the chairman sends a blue-colored form to the Senators representing the home state of 
the nominee. The form seeks the home state Senators’ assessment of the nominee. If a home state 
Senator has no objection to a nominee, the blue slip is returned to the chairman with a positive 
response. If, however, a home state Senator objects to a nominee, the blue slip is either withheld 
or returned with a negative response. 

Q: how is a negative blue slip interpreted
A: If a negative blue slip is received, the chairman may take the following actions
on the nominee: (1) stop all committee proceedings; (2) move forward but give added
weight to the unfavorable review; or (3) proceed without notice of the negative
review. Since the late 1970s, the committee has generally used the latter two actions
when dealing with a negative blue slip. 

Q: how long has the blue slip been in use
A: From
research conducted at the National Archives, evidence suggests that the blue-slip
procedure began sometime in the mid- to late 1910s under the chairmanship of
Senator Charles A. Culberson of Texas.1.

averitec_2393,Fact Check: Eight professionals leave South Africa for every one that comes in.,"Claim: Eight professionals leave South Africa for every one that comes in.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Q&A 1 and 2 show the difficulties of recording the data shown in the claim saying for every one professional  that enters South Africa * professionals leave, and the statistics used were from self-declared emigration, so more accurate data is needed , but form Q&A''s that data does not likely exist at the time of the claim.

Evidence:

Q: How accurate are statistics for professionals leaving South Africa?
A: The focus of this chapter is on emigration of South Africans to other countries for the period 2006
to 2016. Measuring emigration remains a challenge as many emigrants do not declare their
departure to authorities of their countries and most countries have no working mechanisms to
oblige migrants to declare their departure. 

...result indicators such as net migration cannot be derived using this
information.. 

Q: Why is it difficult for accurate figures to be published?
A: Limitations of this chapter include the fact that questions on citizenship and country of birth did not
form part of the profile of emigrants, hence it cannot be established with certainty that these
emigrants are South African nationals. Furthermore an undercount is highly possible since the
count is limited to those individuals who still have family members remaining in the country. As a
result if the whole family emigrated then such statistics could not be collected.. 

Q: Have passport barcodes of South Africans leaving or arriving home been scanned since 2003?
A: No, South African departures and arrivals are no longer required to have passport barcodes scanned at the
ports of entry and exit; therefore, statistics on their departure and arrival are no longer available. Moreover those
departing through the three international airports are no longer required to complete departure forms. This is due
to the implementation of the Immigration Act, 2002 (Act No. 13 of 2002) by the Department of Home Affairs as
from April 2003..

averitec_2394,Fact Check: President Donald Trump wants to abolish the pre-existing conditions protections ...,"Claim: President Donald Trump wants to abolish the pre-existing conditions protections within the U.S Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Trump had his own ideas on how he wanted to improve lives for Americans, so proposed changes to the ACA 

Evidence:

Q: Did President Donald Trump tried  to abolish the pre-existing conditions protections within the U.S Affordable Care Act (ACA) ?
A: - Love it or loathe it, the United States is headed for four years of drastic policy changes under a Donald Trump administration, giving lawmakers another good chance to repeal, replace, or revise the Affordable Care Act.

The landmark healthcare legislation was the centerpiece of one of the most contentious campaigns in American history.  Staring down anticipated premium hikes of up to 25 percent on the public health insurance exchanges, millions of concerned citizens voted for the candidate they felt was most likely to make positive changes to a system that has never quite managed to address their needs.

The impact of a Republican Congressional majority, a Republican President, and a vacant seat on a Supreme Court that already struck down one of the ACA’s major provisions is as of yet unknown, but a conservative twist to our national drama will certainly bring the future of the healthcare coverage framework into question.

For healthcare provider organizations, the plot will thicken even further.  Thanks to provisions that require payers to cover patients with preexisting conditions and adhere to premium caps that have reduced their profitability, the ACA has incentivized a quick shift towards value-based care. 

Eager to trim costs, pay for fewer services, and attract as many patients as possible in a competitive and confusing marketplace, payers have incentivized providers to abandon the traditional fee-for-service reimbursement structure and look to population health management strategies as a way to stem the financial bleeding.

Will significant changes to the Affordable Care Act free up payers to return to more lucrative business practices, or will commercial insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid stay the course?

How can healthcare providers position themselves for success in what will undoubtedly be another turbulent episode in the healthcare saga, and what are the nation’s options for developing a new path forward while still delivering the best possible care. 

Q: What was Trump proposing regarding pre-existing conditions?
A: The American Health Care Act, a bill proposed by House Republicans, required insurance companies to offer coverage regardless of preexisting conditions; however, they could charge more in certain instances.. 

Q: How does this affect those with medical conditions?
A: the AHCA would have required insurers on the individual market to charge 30 percent higher premiums for one year, regardless of health status, to those who didn’t have continuous coverage, defined as a 63-day lapse over the previous 12 months. Plus, states could obtain a waiver that would allow insurers to charge even higher premiums to those with preexisting conditions who didn’t maintain continuous coverage..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q&A 1 shows that as claimed Trump did want to chance the ACA (act).
Q&A 3 shows the claim figure of 32 million is about right as thenumber of uninsured would be 32 million individuals over ten years.
However the claim part about  trump doing this would abolish health insurance for kids who are 26 years of age or younger who are currently on their parents plans is wrong as Q&A 5 shows this not to be effected by a change to the ACA. so some conflicting evidence to the claim.

Evidence:

Q: Does Trump want to abolish the ACA ?
A: He asked the federal courts to find the ACA unconstitutional and nullify the entire law. 

Q: Does trump plan to offer a replacement if the ACA is removed?
A: They would plan to offer an unspecified alternative at a later date should ACA be removed.. 

Q: Where does the 32 million figure come from?
A: The 32 million figure is based on a Congressional Budget Office estimate of the impact of the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017, which would have repealed the ACA altogether and replaced it with an unnamed replacement at a later date. According to the CBO, the plan would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million individuals over ten years..

Justification: this is true, that the labour council tax is lower, but it isn't necessarily set by the council in that area 

Evidence:

Q: Is it true that Labour council is fee £351 lesser than Tory councils ?
A: A major issue with Labour’s calculation is that you often pay council tax to more than one body, which can be run by different political parties.

Q: Does ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) account for individuals whom have multiple convictions and criminal charges?
A: No. Rather than explicitly state whether each conviction and charge has been made by separate individuals- ICE lumps all charges and convictions together.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: This claim has conflicting evidence. According to the QA pairs, the claim is correct to state that ""37 cents out of every US food dollar went into a farmer's pocket"" as a 2015 Congressional Research Service report,  indicates that the farm share was about 37 cents in the 1970-1980 period. However, the claim that ""today it's 15 cents"" seems to be false, as the actual number is 7.8 cents- which is significantly lower. Therefore, this claim has conflicting evidence.

Evidence:

Q: What is a food dollar?
A: The food dollar series measures annual expenditures by U.S. consumers on domestically produced food.. 

Q: What was the farmers share of the food dollar in the 1970-1980 period ?
A: A 2015 Congressional Research Service report, combining several data sets, indicates that the farm share was about 37 cents in the 1970-1980 period. 

Q: What is the current farmers share of the food dollar?
A: 14.6 cents however Under this metric, farm production receives only 7.8 cents of the dollar. The gap between 14.6 cents and 7.8 cents indicates that farms spent 6.8 cents of the money they earned to purchase products from the other industry groups. (After all, even farmers may eat at McDonald’s.) Since Warren used the phrasing about how much of the agriculture dollars “went into a farmer’s pocket,” the lower number of 7.8 cents may be more appropriate than 15 cents. (Even this figure, however, does not account for 1.4 cents that must go to hire labor, so the amount going into “the farmer’s pocket” is even lower.).

Justification: The 2nd Q&A pair point out that the founding date was before 9/11 which is not what is claimed.
However neither the 1st or 2nd Q&A pair mention details about the loss of civel liberties being the cause for the CAIR being founded, with the 2nd Q&A pair stating it was founded to support HAMAS's agendas  in the US, which again is not the reason for CAIR's founding given in the claim.

Q: What causes of death have caused the decline in life expectancy?
A: A CDC report cited three causes of death that have contributed to the decline in life expectancy: drug overdoses and suicides, as Yang said, but also chronic liver disease.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence finds this to be fake. 

Evidence:

Q: Did the Indian government  ordered against publication/sharing politically inclined posts online.
A: Earlier this week, BBC had to issue a clarification that it had not commissioned any pre-poll survey in Karnataka. The reason? A fake survey claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party would win 135 seats in the forthcoming Karnataka elections has been doing the rounds on WhatsApp—with a BBC link provided for legitimacy. The link, of course, merely leads to BBC’s India home page. This is the latest in a long string of fake news that has plagued the build-up to the elections.

Electoral dirty tricks and propaganda have always been a part of politics. Stalin infamously urged writers to become “engineers of human souls"". What is new is the ease and scale with which technology can compromise our political process. The role social media, with its dopamine highs, played in Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election are the standout examples, but it goes beyond that. The US military has been experimenting with “computational propaganda"" in Cuba and the Middle East. The Russians are developing software for information warfare. Then there are drug cartels in Mexico suppressing Twitter debates. Regimes are busy building digital dictatorships—from China’s Citizen Score initiative to Singapore’s “data controlled society"".

This is the evolution of espionage 2.0 with the entire electoral process at risk. Election machinery could be attacked. Data could be stolen, information leaked and systems brought to a standstill. There could be hacks into databases, and cyber attacks on election war rooms and critical Election Commission (EC) infrastructure. This is not fearmongering. To give just two examples, Andrés Sepúlveda is currently serving a prison term in Colombia for manipulating Latin American elections over the past decade. And, in May 2015, Germany discovered a breach of 14 servers in the lower house of its parliament, originating from Russia.

India is not immune to these threats. Prashant Jha, in How BJP Wins: Inside India’s Greatest Election Machine, has written about the s. 

Q: Does the Crime Prevention Council of India have authority to issue instruction on social media use?

Verdict: Supported

Justification: It seems from the 2nd and 3rd QAs that the claim is indeed supported

Evidence:

Q: Did Senator Thom Tillis change position on President Trump's national emergency declaration for border wall funding?
A: A Washington Post reporter called Tillis’ vote a ""remarkable flip-flop."" WRAL’s editorial staff referred to it as a ""flip-flop for the ages."" The Fayetteville Observer’s editorial writers said it was an ""Olympic gold flip-flop."" In a fundraising email, the North Carolina Democratic Party said Tillis ""says one thing, then does another."". 

Q: What did Tillis say about his change of heart?
A: ""My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses. I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order. That’s why I voiced it,"" Tillis said, adding: ""But I’m sympathetic to what he was trying to do … and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here."". 

Q: What had Tillis originally said?
A: ""Although Trump certainly has legitimate grievances over congressional Democrats’ obstruction of border-security funding, his national emergency declaration on Feb. 15 was not the right answer,"" Tillis wrote.

""There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party,"" Tillis wrote..

averitec_2475,Fact Check: The Catholic Church announced that it was introducing burkas for altar servers.,"Claim: The Catholic Church announced that it was introducing burkas for altar servers.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: This information was published on a satire website as per Q&A source information.  Therefore the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: When did Catholic Church introduces burka for altar servers to cover their head ?
A: the wearing of a veil or hat for women seems to have been a fairly consistent practice in the Church in the West until fairly recently. Practices in the Eastern and Orthodox Churches have varied. Protestant denominations also show a wide diversity in this matter. The 1917 Code of Canon Law in  the Catholic Church mandated that women wear a veil or head covering. Prior to 1917 there was no universal Law but it was customary in most places for women to wear some sort of head covering. The 1983 Code of Canon Law made no mention of this requirement and by the 1980s most women, at least here in America, had ceased to wear veils or hats anyway. Currently there is no binding rule and the custom in most places is no head covering at all.

Scripture – In Biblical Times women generally wore veils in any public setting and this would include the Synagogue. The clearest New Testament reference to women veiling or covering their head is from St. Paul:. 

Q: Does the Headcovering Customs of the Ancient  Catholic Church includes wearing burkas ?
A: I offer this survey of ancient headcovering practices in the hope that it will clear away some common misconceptions, and bring into sharper focus the customs which many biblical expositors have held to be so important for an understanding of the Apostle Paul's instruction to the Corinthians regarding headcoverings. Too often I find that the statements made by biblical expositors on this subject are inaccurate and simplistic. The more research I have done on the subject, the more I have come to see how problematic is the widely-accepted interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-16 which asserts that Paul is merely urging the saints in Corinth to conform to local and secular customs. In my opinion this idea raises more problems than it solves.

I conclude that Paul's explanations pertain to an established Christian custom, which may or may not have corresponded to any Jewish, Greek, or Roman custom of the time. Most ""cultural background"" treatments of this subject have failed to recognize the importance of the fact that in the first century the Church was itself a sub-culture, having its own traditions and customs.

This survey was prepared as a supporting document for my exegetical commentary on 1 Corinthians 11:2-16, to which I refer the reader for more specific comments on Paul's explanation of the early Christian custom.n ancient times men did not wear trousers, and women did not wear skirts. There were no shirts or blouses such as we wear today, either. Both sexes usually wore flowing garments comparable to the modern woman's dress. (1) In the Greek language the basic article of clothing was called the chiton (χιτών), and in the Latin language it was called the tunica. (2) In general, women wore a long chiton that reached all the way to the ankles. Over the chiton another garment, called the himation (ἱμάτιον), was worn (see figure 1). In the Latin language this was called the palla (for women) or the pallium (for men). The toga was a garment like the pallium, more V.

Q: In the years between 1990 and 2015, how many maternal deaths did Kenya have?
A: The data covered 1990 to 2015 and showed Kenya had 510 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births and The Kenya Demographic and Health Survey found a maternal mortality ratio of 362 deaths per 100,000 live births from 2007 to 2014. ..

averitec_2496,Fact Check: Obama's 2 terms were a crime spree.,"Claim: Obama's 2 terms were a crime spree.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The info was posted on a meme that went viral, misinformation can be easily spread through social network and people now it's easier for people to choose what to believe.

Evidence:

Q: Where did this claim originate from?
A: A Facebook post. 

Q: What is the format of this claim?
A: It is in meme format with text written over a photo.. 

Q: Why do memes sometimes get shared as if it were verified news?
A: Computer and Information Scientists at Indiana University Bloomington think their model has the answers. Dr. Filippo Menczer, Dr.Xiaoyan Qiu and others at Indiana University Bloomington believe their research demonstrates that these questions can be answered by just three factors: “the enormous amount of information out there; the limited amount of time and attention people can devote to scrolling through their news feeds and choosing what to share; and the structure of the underlying social networks.”

Dr.Menczer talks about if people are being manipulated or tricked:“You could assume that people do know the difference, and still the fake stuff would go viral, simply because of information overload.” The researchers also explain that if the simulation of the networks is assumed to be random- meaning the connections equally distributed throughout the network no memes get shared millions of times. However real-world social networks (like Twitter) have some users who have hundreds of thousands of connections (followers)  and these users tend to tip the scale in favor of certain memes causing them to become viral..

A: Virginia law requires abortions be performed in the second trimester or later and only take place in hospital.. 

Q: Did the Virginia governor Ralph Northam say he supported 'executing new born babies after birth?
A: No. The claim misquotes what he said which was, 
- there may be a fetus that’s non-viable. So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.

Wonderful.’ You know, he killed four people. ‘Here’s — here’s another wonderful.’ … They send us the people they don’t want.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: It seems from the 2nd qa that the process is random. Therefore the claim is refuted 

Evidence:

Q: What is the Visa lottery?
A: Congress established the diversity visa program through the Immigration Act of 1990 in an effort to promote immigration from countries underrepresented in the United States. The number of diversity visas is limited by law to 55,000 per fiscal year, but the annual cap has been reduced to 50,000 since fiscal year 2000. While Congress called this cap a “temporary reduction,” it does not have an expiration date. As of 2017, the U.S. government states that this reduction will remain in effect as long as needed, including for 2019.

The diversity visa program makes up to 50,000 visas available each year to natives of eligible countries. The program is well known as the ""diversity lottery,"" since potential visa recipients are randomly selected from the pool of qualified entries. Yet, being randomly selected—or ""winning"" the lottery—does not guarantee admission to the United States but rather provides the individual an opportunity to apply for the Diversity Visa. The odds of being selected for this opportunity are very small, with an average of 13.3 million people submitting applications each year.. 

Q: Who is eligible for the diversity visa program?
A: Only nationals of low-admission countries—defined as any country with fewer than 50,000 natives admitted to the United States in the previous five years—are eligible to enter the diversity lottery. Natives of countries that traditionally send large numbers of immigrants to the United States, such as Mexico, India, and China, are generally not eligible.

Eligible countries are grouped into six geographic regions: Europe; Africa; Asia; Oceania; North America (excluding Mexico); and South America, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) calculates each region’s annual diversity visa allotment using a specific formula and recent immigration statistics. The allocation formula, which is recalculated every year, gives fewer visas to “high-admission” regions, or any region that accounted for more than a sixth of all immigrant admissions to the United States in the previous five years.   Additionally, no more than 7 percent of the year's available visas may go to natives of any one country.

To be eligible for a diversity visa, applicants must be admissible to the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and have either a high-school education (or its equivalent) or at least two years of recent qualifying work experience. The applicant or the applicant’s spouse must be a native of one of the countries that qualify for the diversity visa program.

The diversity visa program only accepts applications submitted electronically within a short timeframe designated each year. Eligible applicants are limited to one entry per registration period and will be disqualified for submitting multiple entries.. 

Q: What security precautions have been put in place for the Diversity Visa Program?
A: Diversity lottery ""winners"" have a short period of time to file the necessary paperwork and undergo extensive screening before a visa will be issued, including multiple identity confirmations using biometrics, criminal and security background checks, cross-checks with various watch-lists, and in-person interviews. These requirements and security procedures also apply for any family members (spouses and minor children) whom the lottery winner petitions to bring to the United States as derivatives.

An individual may be issued a visa and admitted into the United States only after passing all electronic and in-person screenings. If visa processing for a lottery winner or an eligible family member is not completed before the end of the fiscal year, the U.S. government will deny the application, and the person loses the opportunity to immigrate to the United States through that year's diversity visa program. While the individual may be eligible to enter the diversity lottery in future years, the chances of again being randomly selected to apply for the visa are slim..

averitec_2507,Fact Check: Medicare for All would result in massive tax increases like never before as well...,"Claim: Medicare for All would result in massive tax increases like never before as well as the loss of private coverage for over 180 million Americans.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The tax increases would only effect high level earners however it does seem 180 million policies would be cancelled.

Evidence:

Q: What is Medicare for All?
A: Sanders’ idea of Medicare for All would be a single, national health insurance program that would cover everyone who lives in the United States. In the bill he introduced in 2017, it would pay for every medically necessary service, from routine doctor visits to surgery to mental health to prescription drugs. Dental and vision care are part of the package, too. The details on long-term care might vary between the Senate and House versions, but broadly speaking, nursing home and related care grow under both proposals.

The government would set payment rates for services, drugs and medical equipment. Each year, the secretary of Health and Human Services would determine a national budget for all covered services and spending would be limited by that cap. For individuals, there would be no costs — no deductibles, no copays or coinsurance. The two exceptions would be for some prescription drugs — though that would be limited to $200 a year — and possibly for long-term care.

It would replace all other insurance, with limited exceptions, such as cosmetic surgery. Employer-provided insurance, Medicaid and ultimately Medicare would all disappear.. 

Q: Will taxes rise to pay for Medicare for All?
A: To that, he would raise taxes on income over $250,000, reaching a 52 percent marginal rate on income over $10 million. He suggested a wealth tax on the top 0.1 percent of households.. 

Q: Will Medicare take private coverage away from over 180 million Americans?
A: it would mean that the roughly 180 million Americans who have private insurance would see their plans canceled..

averitec_2508,"Fact Check: When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric (power).","Claim: When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric (power).

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Wind farms are backed up by natural gas peaking plants for when there is no wind or a spike in demand. The electricity from wind turbines can also be stored in lithium batteries at home

Evidence:

Q: Are electricity grids solely dependent on wind?
A: No. They also frequently rely on natural gas peaking plants, which can power up in a matter of minutes to produce electricity when there's a spike in demand or little wind.

""As you think about each resource, they bring a unique profile,"" Chatterjee says. ""We need a balance of those resources. Wind alone doesn't cause reliability issues.""

Q: Is wind power reliable?
A: But in a report released Thursday and an accompanying webinar, experts with the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) explained how wind can actually be seen as a more reliable source than conventional power plants — one that contributes to rather than inhibits the stability of the grid as a whole.. 

Q: Can wind Power be stored?
A: Pumping water back behind hydroelectric dams has been used for decades as a form of storage that absorbs excess generation from the grid and generates electricity later when it is needed by releasing the water to drive a turbine. Now, lithium-ion battery storage in the form of large battery banks is becoming more commonplace in homes, communities, and at the utility-scale..

And we actually save a lot of money, if you can believe it. And I got that approved after 44 years of being unable to get it approved.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the evidence, it looks like veteran groups were not happy with Trump's wording of ""choice,"" as they saw the Veteran Choice Program as a ""privatization,"" and they’d been warning for years that it would cost taxpayers more money and deliver worse care for veterans. However, the veterans groups had endorsed the bill, but Trump’s description of it was not what they thought they were there to support. The VA option appears to cost between $13.9 billion and $32.1 billion over five years. However, it is not clear on the comparison between VA Choice and other veteran healthcare providers. But, based on the evidence, it looks like the VA Choice comes out as a much more expensive deal. More so, Donald Trump was not president in 2014; it was Barack Obama.

Evidence:

Q: When did the Veteran Choice Program start
A: It started with the passing of the H.R.3230 - Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 bill. 

Q: Was the Veteran Choice program cheap
A: Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie acknowledged on Wednesday that his agency got a bad deal in paying nearly $2 billion in fees to companies responsible for booking veterans with private doctors..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The claim that Trump said this is true but the content is not true as power can be stored for later use.

Evidence:

Q: Is wind power a reliable source of electricity?
A: Yes. Because some renewable energy technologies – such as wind and solar – have variable outputs, storage technologies have great potential
For example, when there is more supply than demand, such as during the night when low-cost power plants continue to operate, the excess electricity generation can be used to power storage devices. When demand is greater than supply, storage facilities can discharge their stored energy to the grid.

It seems the 5.3 million figure stated includes some jobs created by his predecessor.

Evidence:

A: The 5.3 million number appears to be slightly higher than the official number from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which says 4.9 million jobs have been created since January 2017..

A: Trump's plan would boost  the size of the economy by about 11% in the long run and create about 5.3 million new jobs.. 

Q: How many jobs has Trump created since he took office?
A: Trump is taking credit for the job gains in the final months of his predecessor's administration, starting the clock on job gains from his election — not his inauguration.

Since Trump has been in office, total nonfarm employment has grown by nearly 4.9 million. The 5.3 million data point includes gains in between his election on Nov. 8, 2016 and his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.

Evidence:

Q: Was CORY AQUINO's Presidency of the Philippines ruled legitimate by any governing body?
A: In a May 22, 1986 ruling, the Supreme Court resolved three petitions which questioned the legality of Aquino’s presidency, saying “the people have made the judgment”. 

The court said, in part: “For the legitimacy of the Aquino government is not a justiciable matter. It belongs to the realm of politics where only the people of the Philippines are the judge.

averitec_2524,Fact Check: The U.S has record bankruptcies in farming country.,"Claim: The U.S has record bankruptcies in farming country.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q&A 1 shows that the farming country the claim refers to is Midwest America, Q&A 3 shows that the Midwest is seeing record bankruptcies as compared as far back as 2014 but that they are not unprecidented as the claim makes out by saying 'record bankruptcies' so there is some cherry-picking of data  up to 2014 at least. as it shows 2010 was worse

Evidence:

Q: What is US farming country?
A: The Midwest is the country’s farming powerhouse. In the small farming communities of the Midwest, farmers often account for one-third of the population, especially in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas. On the coasts, just one or two out of every 100 people work as farmers, even in rural areas. The county with the greatest percentage of farmers is McMullen, Texas. The town’s population is 707, with 374 farmers—that’s more than half of its entire population. If you exclude children and the elderly, the proportion of farmers is even greater. No matter how urban your landscape, though, there’s probably a farmer in the range of a short drive. San Francisco, which has the fewest farmers of all, still boa. 

Q: What is classified as bankruptcy in the US?
A: • Chapter 7 - This is the basic theory of bankruptcy under which a debtor gathers their assets, liquidates them, pays as many bills as possible, and then the unpaid bills go unpaid. ""In this case, the debtor is hoping to hold onto a few dollars so that (he) can keep on going with (his) own life and re-establish some economic foundation for (himself),"" Saxowsky says.

Individual debtors discharge as much debt as possible, but keep as much exempt property as possible for a ""fresh start."" A corporation has no exemptions.

• Chapter 11 - The debtor wants to reorganize and hold onto their business. This is typically used for corporations and individuals whose debt limits are too high to qualify for Chapter 13, a class for wage-earners, Minch says. There are no debt limits in Chapter 11.

Saxowsky says the debtor may have to repay debts over a longer period of time than in the original loan agreement. Debtors continue to run the business as a debtor-in-possession, unless the court finds that assets are improperly managed or that the debtor in possession is violating court orders. Then a trustee is appointed.

• Chapter 12 - This is a special chapter created by Congress in 1985, during the last farm credit crisis. It is especially for smaller ""family farms"" and ""family fisherman"" to avoid liquidation and foreclosure. It was created as a temporary measure and made permanent in 2005.

Roger Minch, a Fargo lawyer who works in business law, says a Chapter 12 is the way to go for farmers in need of debt reorganization, but it's only possible if the farm is within limits.. 

Q: Were there record farming bankruptcies in the US in 2019?
A: 6th Feb 2019
A wave of bankruptcies is sweeping the U.S. Farm Belt as trade disputes add pain to the low commodity prices that have been grinding down American farmers for years.

Throughout much of the Midwest, U.S. farmers are filing for chapter 12 bankruptcy protection at levels not seen for at least a decade, a Wall Street Journal review of federal data shows..

Justification: According to the article linked to the first answer one felony charge was dismissed because, as the judge said, ""Just cashing checks is not evasion"".
Four misdemeanor charges remain.
I don't think that's a ""historic"" victory.

Evidence:

Q: Did Michael Bowman won a historic lawsuit against the IRS ?
A: The judge dismissed the charge without prejudice, meaning prosecutors could seek a new indictment to replace it.  Maddux said the government was considering its options.

Bowman still faces four counts of willful failure to file tax returns, a misdemeanor.. 

Q: Did  Michael Bowman  filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the whole case ?
A: Defendant, Michael Bowman, through his attorney, Matthew 
Schindler, moves the Court to dismiss the indictment alleging violations of 
26 USC §§ 7201 and 7203 because, as applied to him, these criminal charges 
violate his right to maintain his conscience and freely practice his religion as 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and 42 
USC § 2000bb-1 (The Religious Freedom Restoration Act “RFRA”). This 
motion is further supported by the following Memorandum of Law. 

Q: What was  Michael Bowman alleged to have done ?
A: Prosecutors alleged that Bowman hasn't filed an accurate or timely income tax return since at least 1997. When the Oregon Department of Revenue stepped up its enforcement and began garnishing money from Bowman's bank account in January 2012, Bowman changed his method of financial transactions. He began cashing out his work checks, leaving a minimum balance in his bank account, between January 2012 through September 2014, according to the government. Defendant's altered bank behavior removed his income from the reach of taxing authorities and allowed him to avoid payment of assessed taxes.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: No evidence to support or refute claim is available in QA pairs.

They do state 60,000 - 80,000 jobs exist and what the competitiveness program hopes to achieve but not how many people it will support and why only 35,000 of the 60,000 to 80,000 will be supported directly..

Evidence:

Q: What is the clothing and textile competitiveness programme in South Africa?
A: The Clothing and Textiles Competitiveness Programme (CTCP) is a programme of the Department of Trade and Industry (the dti’s) and forms a core part of the implementation of the Customised Sector Programme (CSP’s) for the Clothing, Textiles, Footwear, Leather & Leather Goods Industries. The CTCP’s main objective is to assist industry in upgrading equipment, process, products and people, re-positioning South Africa to compete effectively against other low cost producing countries.. 

Q: How many clothing and textile related jobs are there in South Africa?
A: The Clothing, Textiles, Footwear, and Leather (CTFL) industry is a big deal in South Africa. The CTFL industry currently makes up around 14% of manufacturing employment in the country. This means the sector facilitates an estimated 60 000 to 80 000 jobs..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The answers and source show that the chemical can cause these symptoms in lab animals but no in humans so the claim is cherry picking.

Evidence:

Q: Is Beta-Propiolactone in vaccines?
A: Yes. What you need to know before you receive Flucelvax Tetra

beta-propiolactone, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, or polysorbate 80, which are trace
residues from the manufacturing process.

Q: How does beta-propiolactone get into vaccines?
A: beta-Propiolactone is used for vaccines, tissue grafts, surgical instruments, and enzymes, as a sterilant of
blood plasma, water, milk, and nutrient broth, and as a vapor-phase disinfectant in enclosed spaces.. 

Q: What side effects can Beta-Propiolactone cause?
A: Acute Effects:
Acute inhalation exposure beta-propiolactone causes severe irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and
respiratory tract in humans.  Acute dermal exposure may cause irritation of the skin, blistering, or burns in
humans.  Contact with the eyes may cause permanent corneal opacification. Burns of the mouth and
stomach may occur in humans following acute exposure via ingestion. (1,2)
Acute oral exposure has been observed to result in muscular spasms, respiratory difficulty, and convulsions
at high levels in rats.  In rats acutely exposed intravenously, liver and kidney tubular damage has been
reported. (1,3)
Acute animal exposure tests in rats have demonstrated beta-propiolactone to have extreme acute toxicity
by inhalation. (4)

Chronic Effects (Noncancer):
No information is available on the chronic health effects of beta-propiolactone in humans.
Chronic dermal exposure has resulted in skin irritation, scarring, and hair loss in mice. (1,3)
EPA has not established a Reference Concentration (RfC) or a Reference Dose (RfD) for betapropiolactone.(2)

Reproductive/Developmental Effects:
No information is available on the reproductive or developmental effects of beta-propiolactone in humans
or animals.

Cancer Risk:
No information is available on the carcinogenic effects of beta-propiolactone in humans.
Squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach have been reported in orally exposed rats. (1,6,8)
In several studies of rats and mice exposed to beta-propiolactone via subcutaneous injection, local tumors
have been observed at the site of injection.  Lymphomas and hepatomas have been reported in mice
following intraperitoneal injection. (1,6,8)
In mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs dermally exposed, skin tumors have been observed. (1,6,8)
EPA has not classified beta-propiolactone for carcinogenicity. (2)
IARC has classified beta-propiolactone as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen. (6).

averitec_2550,Fact Check: Formaldehyde is in vaccines and causes cancer in humans among other issues and i...,"Claim: Formaldehyde is in vaccines and causes cancer in humans among other issues and is banned from vaccines in most European countries

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers and sources show that it is a very small dose and is not banned in Europe so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Is formaldehyde in vaccines?
A: Yes, It is used in the production of some vaccines to inactivate toxins from bacteria and viruses (for example, poliovirus, Hepatitis B antigen, and diphtheria and tetanus toxins). It is possible that tiny traces may remain in the 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix Hexa), Hepatitis B vaccine (HBVaxPro), one of the Pre-school Booster vaccines (Repevax), and the Teenage Booster vaccine (Revaxis). However, formaldehyde breaks down quickly in water (and most of the vaccine is water).. 

Q: How much formaldehyde is in the vaccines?
A: The human body produces and uses formaldehyde as part of the process of metabolism. The amount of natural formaldehyde in a 2-month-old infant’s blood (around 1.1 milligrams in total) is ten times greater than the amount found in any vaccine (less than 0.1 milligrams). A pear contains around 50 times more formaldehyde than is found in any vaccine.. 

Q: Is formaldehyde banned for use in Europe?
A: No: The EU is taking further steps to protect workers from exposure to carcinogens. The Council today adopted its position (general approach) on a proposal which will update the existing rules on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Directive 2004/37/EC). The aim of the proposal, which was presented by the Commission in April this year, is to reduce the exposure levels for 5 carcinogenic chemical agents - cadmium, beryllium, arsenic acid, formaldehyde and 4,4'-Methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline)(MOCA).

Estimates show that this proposal, when adopted, would in the longer term improve working conditions for over 1 000 000 workers in the EU and should prevent more than 22 000 cases of work-related ill-health. It is a very good example of how the EU is taking concrete steps to protect its citizens.

Justification: Q&A 1 confirms that an allergic reaction to the ingredients in the claim is possible but only in some people.
Q&A 2 and 3  states the ingredients are only used in production of some vaccines, which gives an impression they are not in the final injected product, 

Evidence:

Q: When would a reaction occur for these substances?
A: When someone is severely allergic. 

Q: Is gentamicin Sulphate found in vaccines?
A: It is an antibiotic and used in the production of vaccines to stop bacteria growing in them.

Because of this, only trace amounts of these can end up in vaccines. 

Q: Is polymyxin B found in vaccines?
A: It is an antibiotic and used in the production of vaccines to stop bacteria growing in them.

Because of this, only trace amounts of these can end up in vaccines.

It is linked to autoimmune disorders, including autism.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Mercury is not in the vaccines. 

Evidence:

Q: Is the mercury-based chemical thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) found in vaccines?
A: Thiomersal was removed from UK vaccines between 2003 and 2005, and is no longer found in any of the childhood or adult vaccines routinely used in the UK. Before 2005, thiomersal was present in diphtheria- and tetanus-containing vaccines, as well as hepatitis B vaccine and some flu vaccines. It was not used in the MMR vaccine, the Hib vaccine, the MenC vaccine, the oral polio vaccine or the BCG vaccine. Thiomersal was present in the Swine Flu (H1N1) vaccine Pandemrix, used in the 2009-10 and 2010-11 flu seasons in the UK. However, it is not present in any of the annual flu vaccines currently in use in the UK.. 

Q: Why was the mercury-based chemical thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) removed from vaccines?
A: In the US, UK and Europe, thiomersal was removed from vaccines as a precaution. This was in line with the global goal of reducing environmental exposure to mercury from all sources.. 

Q: Was the mercury-based chemical thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) in vaccines harmful to humans?
A: ...there was no evidence that thiomersal in vaccines caused harm. Thiomersal contains a compound called ethyl mercury, but concern about mercury in the environment has centred on a different compound called methyl mercury, which accumulates in the food chain and in the human body..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There were fewer bankruptcies in 2018 than there were in 2017. From the evidence, it also looks as though the median income was not $1,548. Hence, this claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: Do farmers make all their money from their farm?
A: Income (farm-operator households receive income from farm and off-farm sources):. 

Q: What are off farm resources?
A: Off-farm sources—including wage income, nonfarm business earnings, dividends, and transfers—are the main contributor to income for most farm operator households in the United States, including the majority of residential and intermediate farm households (see glossary for definitions). These households, which derive less than half their income from farming, are not as affected by changes in farming costs and returns as are large commercial farms, but may be more susceptible to changes in the broader economy.. 

Q: Are farmers seeing a decline in their income and declaring bankruptcy in record numbers?
A: Many farm households primarily rely on off-farm income: median off-farm income in 2021 is estimated at $82,809, an increase of 22 percent from $67,873 in 2020, and to continue increasing by 6.3 percent to $88,034 in 2022. The increase in 2021 was mainly due to higher earned income—income from wages, salary, and nonfarm businesses—which rose 54 percent from $32,428 in 2020 to $50,000 in 2021..

Evidence:

Q: What is agri-market infrastructure?
A: in order to improve market accessibility and to facilitate the farmers to directly sell their produce to the consumer to get better price realization for their produce, the Government has announced in Union Budget 2018-19, to develop and upgrade existing 22000 rural haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs). In these GrAMs, physical infrastructure will be strengthened using Government Schemes such as MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act). These GrAMs are to be exempted from regulations of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMCs) and linked to e-NAM to provide farmers with better market accessibility and facilities to sell their produce at remunerative prices’..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The decision does not depend on the foreign countries but on the United states government 

Evidence:

Q: What is the US Visa lottery system?
A: Congress established the diversity visa program through the Immigration Act of 1990 in an effort to promote immigration from countries underrepresented in the United States. The number of diversity visas is limited by law to 55,000 per fiscal year, but the annual cap has been reduced to 50,000 since fiscal year 2000. While Congress called this cap a “temporary reduction,” it does not have an expiration date. As of 2017, the U.S. government states that this reduction will remain in effect as long as needed, including for 2019.. 

Q: Do countries send immigrants to the US lottery.
A: No. Potential visa recipients are randomly selected from the pool of qualified entries, administered by the United States, not foreign governments. Yet, being randomly selected—or ""winning"" the lottery—does not guarantee admission to the United States but rather provides the individual an opportunity to apply for the Diversity Visa. The odds of being selected for this opportunity are very small, with an average of 13.3 million people submitting applications each year.

Justification: Although nothing confirmed for definite the consensus in the answers point towards it being unlikely.

Evidence:

Q: How likely was it that the US was on the precipice of war with North Korea during Obama's tenure?

Q: What was Obama's strategy with North Korea during his time as president?
A: The overall policy toward North Korea during Obama’s tenure was ""strategic patience"" — the notion that ""if we ignore them, they will go away and eventually implode,"" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org.

There’s room for disagreement about how effective ""strategic patience"" was. But it was ""not the same thing as preparing for war, or planning a war, or even intending to conduct a war,"" said Joseph DeThomas, a professor at the Penn State School of International Affairs.

averitec_2562,Fact Check: President Obama put more debt on the USA than any president in the history of ou...,"Claim: President Obama put more debt on the USA than any president in the history of our country combined.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The debt before Obama was around $10 trillion, and he added around $9 trillion to that, so it is slightly less than the debt of all presidents before him combined.

Evidence:

Q: What is the total amount in national debt during President Barack Obama’s administration ?
A: President Barack Obama’s administration racked up nearly as much debt in eight years than in the entire 232-year history of the country before he took office. He entered with $10.6 trillion in total debt and left with the country owing $19.9 trillion. That’s an average tab of $1.16 trillion a year.. 

Q: How much debt the US government added under President Obama ?
A: Based on quarterly data released by the US Treasury, the debt at the end of 2008 — just before Obama took office — stood at roughly $10,699,805,000,000. As of the third quarter of 2016, the most recent data available, the debt as Obama is set to leave office stood at $19,573,445,000,000.

Based on the website USdebtclock.com, which extrapolates the US national debt in real time based on committed government spending, the debt will be roughly $19.97 trillion when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Friday.

Thus, the national debt under Obama will have grown by about $9 trillion, or an increase of 86%.

Some of this debt is attributable to bills passed by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, since the federal government's fiscal year budget operate differently from the calendar year.

A: Congressionally-authorized emergency presidential powers are sweeping and dramatic, and range from suspending all laws regulating chemical and biological weapons, including the ban on human testing (50 U.S.C.. 

Q: Did Obama use emergency powers  to do with criminal cartels?
A: Obama did use emergency powers to freeze the financial assets of four foreign criminal operations, but it’s unclear how that would help build a wall.

On July 25, 2011, Obama announced that ""significant transnational criminal organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States."".

Most lottery winners reside outside the United States and immigrate through consular processing and issuance of an immigrant visa. To learn more, visit the U.S. Department of State's website.. 

Q: Do other countries put people into the DV programme?
A: No. Individuals must register for the programme.

A: Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, called the amount of opioids coming through ports of entry a ""real threat."" She said people should know that opioids arrive in the United States through smugglers approaching legal points of entry.

""The facts are, the majority of opioids and all kinds of other things that are connected to the opioids are coming through the point of entry,"" she said.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is not enough available reliable data on executions, and despite this, it is only one option in China, so the claim is not correct regardless. 

Evidence:

Q: What is the penalty for drug related offences in China
A: individuals who smuggle, traffic, transport or manufacture drugs and meet certain conditions are to be punished with 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, life imprisonment or death sentence, and confiscation of their properties.but data on executions is unreliable. 

Q: What are the penalties for drug possession and drug related offences in the United States
A: As a general rule, federal judges must impose a minimum term of imprisonment upon defendants convicted of various controlled substance (drug) offenses and drug-related offenses. The severity of those sentences depends primarily upon the nature and amount of the drugs involved, the defendant’s prior criminal record, any resulting injuries or death.

averitec_2570,Fact Check: US President Obama was ready to have gone to war with North Korea.,"Claim: US President Obama was ready to have gone to war with North Korea.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: This claim is refuted. According to the QA pairs, President Obama's close aides said he was ""never close to an attack"" even when North Korea reported a nuclear test. President Obama reportedly said that a ground invasion of North Korea is ""unthinkable"". The claim states that he was ""ready to go to war"" and that clearly wasn't the case. Therefore, the claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: Did Barack obamas cabinet have anything to say about the claim?
A: We were not on the brink of war with North Korea in 2016,” Benjamin J. Rhodes, Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser, wrote on Twitter.

John Brennan, Mr. Obama’s C.I.A. director, told NBC News, “President Obama was never on the verge of starting any war with North Korea, large or small.”. 

Q: Were there any other reports about Obama wanting war?
A: In his most recent book, Bob Woodward (Washington post) reported that after a North Korean nuclear test in September 2016, Mr. Obama asked if a surgical strike could take out the country’s arsenal, but after being told it would require a ground invasion, he rejected any action as “unthinkable.” His former aides say he never came close to ordering an attack..

A young man killed eight people and brought in many people because of chain migration.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: An immigrant cannot bring in 20+ people into the United States 

Evidence:

Q: Who is Trump referring to here?
A: Sayfullo Saipov, the Uzbekistan-born suspect on trial for the 2017 truck attack in New York,. 

Q: Did he bring in many people?
A: No. s a green card holder, he could only petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States. Media reports indicate that Saipov married a woman who already lived in the United States and that their three children were born in the United States

Q: Is it possible for an immigrant to bring 20+ other family members?
A: No. Theoretically, one immigrant’s arrival in the United States could lead to the immigration of an aunt or uncle — if the first immigrant becomes a U.S. citizen and petitioned a parent, that parent could eventually become a U.S. citizen and petition his or her siblings.

But no one can directly petition an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent. Citizens may sponsor other types of immediate family members for immigration, such as brothers and sisters, although except for spouses, parents and young children, the numbers they can sponsor are limited. Green card holders, in contrast, may petition only on behalf of spouses and unmarried children.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has appellate jurisdiction over some of the states in the US southern border 

Evidence:

Q: What is the emergency order to secure funding for a border wall?
A: President Donald Trump has officially declared a national emergency in order to secure funding for his border wall. 
Trump is issuing the declaration under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, which lets presidents issue an emergency declaration but under certain constraints — namely, Trump can only use specific powers Congress has already codified by law, and he has to say which powers he’s using. The act doesn’t define what counts as an emergency… there’s enough ambiguity in the law to let Trump declare an emergency. But the maneuver may not stand up to legal scrutiny once challenged in court. He is effectively trying to circumvent Congress — which is supposed to have the “power of the purse” and has decided against funding his border wall.. 

Q: Which US states are part of the border wall between the US and Mexico?
A: U.S. states along the border are California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.. 

Q: What lawsuits could emerge in the border states as a result of the emergency order to secure funding for the border wall?
A: Long before Trump’s emergency declaration, one likely source of resistance has been clear: people who own land along the US-Mexico border where Trump wants the wall to be built.
The federal government can legally invoke “eminent domain,” a power to take private land or property and convert it into public use enshrined within the US Constitution, but if Trump tries to do so for the border wall, he could very well face a fight. Landowners could sue, as they did after Bush’s order, to keep the government from taking their land..

Because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in. They’re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It’s common sense.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answers show that there are requirements to be able to be put in the lottery so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What Lottery does the claim refer to?
A: the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,

also known as the green-card lottery, issues up to 50,000 visas a year to people from dozens of countries, a tiny fraction of the roughly 1 million green cards the government issues annually. The aim is to mix up the nation’s melting pot.. 

Q: Is the'' diversity lottery program'' in the U.S insecure?
A: No. Applicants who are selected in the program (“selectees”) must meet simple but strict eligibility
requirements to qualify for a diversity visa. such as education and work requirements to be eligible. and background checks and security screenings for those selected

Justification: From the evidence, it looks as though certain ""big"" drugs do go through US ports of entry. 90 percent of heroin seized along the border, 88 percent of cocaine, and 84 percent of the methamphetamine in the 2018 fiscal year were caught trying to be smuggled in at legal crossing points.
The exception is marijuana, only 39 percent of which was seized at ports of entry, according to the CBP.

Evidence:

Q: What drugs are considered to be “big drugs” in the United States?
A: The most commonly abused drugs are:
Marijuana
Cocaine
Opiates e.g. Heroin
Methamphetamine.

The exception is marijuana, only 39 percent of which was seized at ports of entry, according to the CBP.. 

Q: If US government data shows the majority of the drugs seized along the border were seized at the ports of entry, does this conclusively prove that most drugs in the US come through legal ports of entry?

Q: What has Beto O’Rourke said about veterans?
A: I will strengthen services for those who have put their lives on the line for this country.

My top priority while serving in Congress was delivering for Texas veterans. Serving on both the Veterans Affairs and Armed Services committees in the U.S. House of Representatives, I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to lift up the heroes who have put their lives on the line for our country.
My VA health care reform plan added two new VA clinics in my hometown of El Paso, nearly doubled the number of mental health providers at the local VA, and ultimately brought wait times down from an average of 71 days to an average of 5 days.

In addition, I authored and passed legislation that expanded access to VA mental health care to veterans with other-than-honorable discharges, granted every separating service member access to a mental health screening, improved and customized transition assistance for service members leaving the military—and more.

Texas can and must do more to serve our veterans. As governor, I will prioritize efforts to end veteran homelessness in Texas by the end of my first year in office, cut property taxes for disabled and low-income veterans, dramatically expand the state’s veterans health care case management system, strengthen services for veterans suffering from toxic exposure, expand access to medical marijuana and other alternatives to harmful opioids, and strengthen access to the education and employment benefits that our veterans have earned..

""Estimated non-EU net migration, meanwhile, is 261,000 a year""
57,000 plus 261,000 is a net migration of 308,000.. 

Q: How might Brexit affect net migration into the UK?
A: ""A conservative estimate is that the United Kingdom would continue to receive an inflow of 500,000 or more immigrants per year, with annual net migration above 200,000."". 

Q: Did Migration Watch withdraw this claim?
A: We have decided to withdraw the paper issued today on post-Brexit migration levels. There was an error in the calculations which was unfortunately overlooked at the final stages of preparation. We apologise for the error and will rectify it in the course of producing a revised version..

Evidence:

A: To totally overhaul transportation by massively expanding electric vehicle  manufacturing, build charging stations everywhere, build out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary, create affordable public transit available to all, with goal to replace every combustion-engine vehicle - as listed under 'National mobilization our economy through 14 infrastructure and industrial projects.' - Every project strives to remove greenhouse gas emissions and pollution from every sector of our economy, as part of the 'Resolution Summary'. 

Q: How does Liz Cheney suggest that air travel will be eliminated?
A: Liz Cheney stated, ""I would just say that it’s going to be crucially important for us to recognize and understand when we outlaw plane travel, we outlaw gasoline, we outlaw cars, I think actually probably the entire US military because of the Green New Deal that we are able to explain to our constituents and to people all across this country what that really means. And even when it comes down to something like air travel, which the FAQ’s say they want to eliminate within the next ten years."".

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The Mayor of El Paso tweeted ""We‘ve had a fence for 10 years and it has impacted illegal immigration and curbed criminal activity. It is NOT the sole deterrent.

Q: What was the violent crime rate in El Paso before the border fence was constructed?

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The evidence found only dates back to 2017 data. We would need data from 2018 to clarify whether this claim is supported or not. However, the claim states 12,000 km of tarmac were constructed in 50 years, but one of the answers states 20,600 km of bitumen roads in 2017. According to one source, it was 13,180 kilometers. Therefore, there is conflicting evidence.

Justification: Based on the available data from the QA the figures appears to be slightly off and this makes the claim wrong and so it's refuted. In 2013/14 4,713,662 had health insurance, in 2017/18 it had 7,657,463 and as QA pair 3 calculates this is an increase of nearly 3 million but the initial figure in the claim is much lower than the actual statistics from 2013/14 by 1.7 million so it's not risen quite as much as the claim suggests.

Justification: The track length is around 600km and the sources are reliable. 

Evidence:

Q: What line are Kenya building?
A: To improve its economy, Kenya is building a rail line that can carry both higher-speed trains and heavier cargo.. 

Q: What is the current route length?
A: The first phase of the standard-gauge railway (SGR) from the coastal city of Mombasa to the capital Nairobi has already been built. But several sources have recently put the length at 472 kilometres.

These include the president’s delivery unit, State House, the China Road and Bridge Corporation – the Chinese firm that built it – and the Kenya Institute for Public Policy and Research Analysis, a government think tank.

The Kenya Railways Corporation puts the “route length” at 472 km. 

Q: How long is the track length?
A: The Kenya Railways Corporation puts the “route length” at 472 km and the  “track length” at 609 km - closer to the deputy president’s figure.

The main line is 472 km and the total track built 607.4 km, the SGR office told Africa Check. The difference is because there are areas on the main line with multiple tracks. These include two main stations and seven intermediate stations..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: This claim is suppported. According to the QA pairs, the current Kenyan government have built a standard gauge railway which consists of a modern, efficient transport system that makes travel safe, comfortable and affordable for passengers across the country. The Office of th President of Kenya has stated that amount of track that has so far been laid is 472km. 472km is part of phase 1 of the project, implying there is more track to be laid. However, the claim states that 600km of track has been laid over the past 5 years. In the metadata provided, a spokesperson from the office of SGR stated that ""the main line is 472 km and the total track built 607.4 km... the difference is because there are areas on the main line with multiple tracks. These include two main stations and seven intermediate stations."" The previously stated number of 472km stated seems to be exclusive to the main train line laid, whilst the figure of 607.4km is conclusive of everything intermediate stations. Therefore, the claim is supported as, despite being 'main track' or not, 607.4km (600 kiometres in the claim) has been laid in Kenya.

Evidence:

Q: What is the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)?
A: The Standard Gauge Railway is a modern, efficient transport system that will enable safe, comfortable travel for individuals and freight across the country and region at lower costs.. 

Q: How much of the SGR has already been built?
A: Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Nairobi has seen 472km of track completed. 

Q: Has any mention been made between the amount of track laid vs the amount laid in the claim?
A: The main line is 472 km and the total track built 607.4 km, the SGR office told Africa Check. The difference is because there are areas on the main line with multiple tracks. These include two main stations and seven intermediate stations..

Evidence:

Q: Is there any public record to prove that Kenya's railway project has been in the books of the government for 30 years ?
A: Kenya’s transport ministry says the railway’s journey started in 2007 while a 2009 railway masterplan study for the East Africa Community says the project was developed in 2007.

We have not found any publicly available record that the railway was in the works 30 years ago – in the 1980s or 1990s.. 

Q: What is the railway like in Kenya?
A: The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project is one of Kenya's Vision 2030 flagship projects that will play an important role in improving the transport system as well as strengthening cooperation among East Africa Community (EAC) Member states and promote economic development of the region.

The old meter gauge line, initially called the Uganda Railway, was built between 1896 and 1901, a time when the land had yet to acquire the name Kenya. For British colonists, it was a vast yet insignificant land that stood between them and the rich resources in Uganda. To open up Uganda, to tighten control over the ""British East Africa"" and to end the then notorious slave trade, the British government decided to lay a rail line to link the port of Mombasa and Uganda..

Q: Was the planning of gauge railway was being done by the Kenyan government for 30 years ?
A: .No, the earliest reference to this project emerged during a summit of the Eastern African Community in 2004. In 2009, a regional Northern Corridor Initiative between Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda was formed to promote a sustainable freight transport system, which would later expand to other countries in the Great Lakes Region..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: while the claim is technically correct, as the real figure IS ""over 700,000"" the figure is 2 million which is quite significantly more than 700,00 so while technically true, it is inaccurate.

A: Yes. The statement is technically correct as he stated ""over"" 700,000 children.

Evidence:

Q: How much natural gas did the US export in 2018?
A: Since exports of U.S. LNG began in 2016, over 1.3 trillion cubic feet of U.S. natural gas has been exported.. 

Q: How much oil did the US import in 2016?

Imports fell from 8.9 million barrels per day in September 2011 to a low of 7.1 million barrels per day in June 2014, a 20.7-percent decline. Crude oil imports remained below 7.5 million barrels per day as production slowed during the second half of 2015. Domestic production also slipped over the rest of 2015, falling to 9.2 million barrels per day by the end of the year.. 

Q: Why does the US import and export oil?

Evidence:

Q: Has there been independent research into the price of drugs around the world?
A: Yes. Including by the RAND corporation.

Q: Is the RAND corporation a reliable source?
A: Yes. 'The RAND Corporation, according to the corporate web site, is a ""nonprofit institution that helps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis"" and maintains that pursuing its core objectives of ""quality"" and ""objectivity"" requires it to be nonpartisan.'

Q: What does the RAND corporation report say about drug prices in the USA compared to the rest of the world?
A: The United States spends more on prescription drugs on a per capita basis than most other countries do. Understanding the extent to which drug prices are higher in the United States than in other countries—after accounting for differences in the volume and mix of drugs—is useful when developing and targeting policies to address both growth in drug spending and the financial impact of prescription drugs on consumers.

Prices in the United States are higher than those in all comparison countries
U.S. prices were 256 percent of those in the 32 comparison countries combined.

In comparisons with individual countries, U.S. prices ranged from 170 percent of prices in Mexico to 779 percent of prices in Turkey.

The gap between U.S. prices and prices in other countries was larger for brand-name originator drugs.

U.S. prices were 84 percent of prices in all non-U.S. countries for unbranded generics.

U.S. prices were 190 percent of prices in other countries after adjusting U.S. prices downward to account for rebates and other discounts..

• A weekly guideline on regular drinking;
• Advice on single episodes of drinking; and
• A guideline on pregnancy and drinking.
On regular drinking
New weekly guideline [this applies for people who drink regularly or frequently i.e. most
weeks].
The Chief Medical Officers’ guideline for both men and women is that:
• You are safest not to drink regularly more than 14 units per week, to keep health
risks from drinking alcohol to a low level.
• If you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over
3 days or more. If you have one or two heavy drinking sessions, you increase
your risks of death from long term illnesses and from accidents and injuries.
• The risk of developing a range of illnesses (including, for example, cancers of
the mouth, throat and breast) increases with any amount you drink on a regular
basis.
• If you wish to cut down the amount you’re drinking, a good way to help achieve
this is to have several drink-free days each week..

Q: Is the Kenya Ports Authority looking to hire 140 people, aged 18–35, who have graduated from a well-recognized university between 2012 and 2018?
A: No. The attention of the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) Management has been drawn to the actions of some fraudsters who are inviting unsuspecting job seekers for employment at the Authority. The deceitful advert targeting the youth has been circulated via social media and other online platforms.

We wish to clarify that KPA has a clear recruitment policy which includes publishing of vacancies in the mainstream newspapers and on the KPA website www.kpa.co.ke. Thereafter, formal communication on interviews for shortlisted applicants is undertaken. It should also be noted that the Authority has official domain email addresses which are on our website and not the gmail address indicated in the fake advert. Further, it should be noted that all recruitment activities in KPA are devoid of any payments.

Members of the public are therefore advised to ignore the messages circulating on social media and other online platforms purporting that KPA has advertised 140 vacancies targeting diploma and degree holders. This is a hoax. We therefore advise members of the public to beware of such conmen/fraudsters and to imme- diately report any such incidents to the Authority or the nearest Police Station.
KPA is committed to best practice and the principles of transparency and equal employment opportunities to all, when such opportunities arise, as enunciated in the Constitution of Kenya.

averitec_2755,Fact Check: The German press launched a massive campaign to discredit Russian and Russian la...,"Claim: The German press launched a massive campaign to discredit Russian and Russian language media.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: From the question and answer pair it seems that the Russians are not discredited, but the action from other countries is due to their own actions. Therefore, the label is refuted

Evidence:

Q: Has there been any evidence that the German press has tried to supress or discredit Russian language media?
A: Earlier in January, the German Association of Journalists (DJV) urged the state media regulatory authorities not to grant a broadcasting license to the channel Russia Today for its website RT Deutsch.

“Russia Today is not an information medium for us, but a propaganda instrument of the Kremlin, which tries to make politics with disinformation,"" said DJV Federal Chairman Frank Überall. He added that, RT ""has repeatedly invented stories in the past."" There should not be a broadcasting license for a propaganda station."". 

Q: Was this a campaign against Russian Media?
A: No. Following Zakharova’s press conference on January 31, DJV issued a statement saying that there was no campaign against Russian foreign media in Germany, there is only “unanimous criticism toward the methods of their work.”

The editor-in-chief of T-online.de Florian Harms, and Christian Mihr, the Managing Director of the German office of “Reporters without Borders,” an International NGO based in Paris, joined in denying the Russian allegations.

The German government also rejected Russian MFA’s accusations that German press, in cooperation with the government, are waging a campaign against Russian media. Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert said, “Those who spread such unfounded claims have little to no idea of Germany and little idea of freedom of the press. I explicitly reject such allegations.”

Q: Why are German media critic of Russia?
A: RT and Sputnik face mistrust not only in Germany, but throughout most of Europe, including Britain and France. The French government has opened an investigation into possible Russian interference during the Yellow Vest protests last year, when social-media accounts linked to Moscow spread false news published by Russia Today and Sputnik.

An earlier fact check established that Moscow used the two outlets to undermine Emmanuel Macron’s presidential election campaign in 2017.

Macron has stated openly in the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin that “Russia Today and Sputnik were agents of influence and propaganda that spread falsehoods about me and my campaign.”

And in December 2018, UK’s media regulator Ofcom, which has launched numerous probes of RT activities, found that the Russian channel has failed to comply with Britain’s broadcasting rules, which could result in fines and ultimately revocation of its broadcast license..

Q: Does Germany have an outstanding debt to the UK from damages that occurred during World War 2 ?
A: No the debts were written off in 1990: In 1990, the treaty on the final settlement with respect to Germany was signed by West Germany, East Germany, the US, the UK, the Soviet Union and France. It allowed the recently reunited Germany to have full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs. The Government considers that that treaty definitively settled between the parties matters arising out of the second world war. The treaty was laid before the House for clearance under the Ponsonby rule. The Government have no plans to reopen any claim for reparations from Germany in respect of losses sustained during world war two, including for damage caused to UK cities..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Evidence is not clear on whether subsidizing is a bad thing and whether it would be profitable if wind turbines were not subsided. Also, the U.S. also ranks first in the world for electricity generated from wind - meaning the U.S. depends heavily on wind power. 

Evidence:

Q: Does USA have wind turbines?
A: Yes. The United States ranks first in the world for electricity generated from wind, according to the Department of Energy.. 

Q: Does USA have a subsidy system for wind turbines?
A: A 2017 report by Management Information Services Inc found that non-hydro renewable energy (primarily wind and solar) benefited from $158 billion in federal subsidies, or 16% of the total energy subsidies, largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development (R&D).. 

Q: What do America's Wind Turbines cost to product a Megawatt of electricity?

We don’t. Satanists are atheists. We see the universe as being indifferent to us, and so all morals and values are subjective human constructions.

Our position is to be self-centered, with ourselves being the most important person (the “God”) of our subjective universe, so we are sometimes said to worship ourselves. Our current High Priest Gilmore calls this the step moving from being an atheist to being an “I-Theist.”

Satan to us is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential. We do not believe in Satan as a being or person..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The claim refers to school attendance but the QA pair relates to school  enrolment.

Many pupils maybe enrolled but fail to attend.

There is no QA pair stating attendance levels at time of claim to support or refute the 99% in claim.

Evidence:

Q: What was the school enrolment rates for children aged 7-15 in 1994 in South Africa?
A: No exact answer could be found, but this is found - The South African Schools ‘Act (1996) makes schooling compulsory for children aged 7
to 15. This has resulted in the sustained participation of over 95% in schooling since the
mid to late 1990s.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Q&A 1 shows that the figure of 15 billion in the claim that was donated by the Nafas in the year before the claim (2018) is almost 1 billion short, with it showing 14.1 billion donated over 2017-2018.
Q&A 3 does say financial aid has increased over recent years which agrees with the claim, but Q&A 3 only shows a figure for what it has increased from in 1991 (22million) not 1994 which is the claim point, so more evidence would be needed for an accurate judgment.

Q: How much financial aid was given by the Nafas in 1994?

50%), African students (most – 21 of 24 years – this is higher than 85%)
followed by Coloured students, then Indian and then white students
(usually between 1,7% to 3,9%).

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: While the answers support this number, the evidence is based on the assumption of the NHS England’s Chief Executive, who has written the plan, which makes it probably biased. Further independent evidence is needed to support or deny the claim.

Evidence:

Q: What is The NHS Long Term Plan?
A: The new plan focuses on what the NHS can deliver, and how. In terms of what, the aim is to shift the NHS model of care further upstream: more preventive care, closer integration of services in the community for people with chronic conditions, better coordination of urgent care to reduce demand on emergency departments, and outpatient visits reduced by a third. Improvements are promised in priority services, including mental health, maternity, and cancer. And there is a welcome emphasis on the NHS’s role in tackling health inequalities. Gaps in life expectancy in England are wide, growing, and unjust.5. 

Q: How will the NHS Long Term Plan save 500,000 lives?
A: NHS England’s Chief Executive, Simon Stevens, has written the plan at the request of the prime minister. He says it can save up to half a million lives by focusing on killer conditions and getting people to live healthier lifestyles..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: It seems that the  umbers were slightly different, therefore the claim is refuted

Evidence:

Q: What was the capital expenditure component of Nigeria's spending in 2016?
A: The capital expenditure component of the spending in 2016 was only N173bn of the projected N1.58tn. However, some of the capital expenses were carried into the new fiscal year 2017 in line with the clause attached to the Appropriation act.. 

Q: What was the capital expenditure component of Nigeria's spending in 2017?
A: the Minister of Power, Works and Housing (PWH), Babatunde Raji Fashola suggest that his ministry did not complete any capital project in 2017, despite receiving the largest capital expenditure allocation across all parastatals. 

Despite the Ministry's reports, the Debt Management Office (DMO) stated that it released ₦1.2 trillion to finance capital projects in 2017. Given the size of Mr Fashola's ministry, it is improbable that they received none of these funds. The implication is that the Ministry received these funds too late in the year to execute for that calendar year.

That is highly plausible. Afterall, in December 2017, the Minister of Finance announced the Ministry released ₦750 billion for capital projects. These projects effectively become 2018 projects..

Justification: Q&A 1 does show unemployment had increased from the years previous to the claim, but more past data would be needed to see how bad it s current figures are for the broad ranging claim Q&A 3 shows that unemployment data collection changed in 2014 so comparing historical figures with current figures would be wrong for unemployment figures in Nigeria, making it difficult to use the data for unemployment in Nigeria shown in Q&A 1 So a more detailed breakdown of unemployment figures would be needed to support or refute the claim.

A: From July to September 2017 the country’s unemployment rate increased to 18.8% from 16.2% in the previous three months.. 

Q: Have there been higher levels of unemployment in Nigeria before this?
A: In 2011, the unemployment rate was higher - at 23.9%..

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The answers do not cover whether local governments are trying to tackle the problem or proof that they have been told to deal with the problem so there is not enough evidence.

Evidence:

Q: What are Almajiris?
A: In Nigeria, Almajiri is any child or adult who begs for assistance in the streets or from house to house. Islamic teachings strongly prohibit begging except in very special circumstances.
The majority of Almajiris in Nigeria are children from 3 to 18 years old. Community leaders say these children are totally neglected by their parents.. 

Q: Are Nigerian children entitled to a free education?

Universal basic education for every child of primary and junior secondary, school age.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The U.S. has the second-highest number of homicides, behind Brazil, even if you remove the cities of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C., St. Louis, and New Orleans from the total.

Evidence:

Q: Does the United States rank third in murders throughout the world and would removing the cities of Chicago, Detroit, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and New Orleans from the total make the U.S. 189th out of 193 countries in the world in homicides?
A: No, that's not true: The U.S.has the second highest number of homicides -- behind Brazil -- but the nation's murder rate (the number of homicides for every 100,000 population) is way down the chart globally.

Q: How many registration votes by African Americans were put on hold?
A: 70% of votes by African Americans were put on hold..

Verdict: Supported

Justification: The irregular expenditure increased from R23 million in 2016-2017 to R44 in 2017-2018 which is an increase of R21 million. 

Evidence:

Q: What is irregular expenditure?
A: Irregular expenditure is expenditure that was not incurred in the manner prescribed by legislation; in other words, somewhere in the process that led to the expenditure, the auditee did not comply with the applicable legislation.
Such expenditure does not necessarily mean that money had been wasted or that fraud had been committed. It is an indicator of non-compliance in the process that needs to be investigated by management to determine whether it was an unintended error, negligence or done with the intention to work against the requirements of legislation (which, for example, require that procurement should be fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective)..

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: QA pairs conflict each other. Some state dry out skin and helps and others say cause further irritation.

Evidence:

Q: Are there ingredients in toothpaste that help reduce acne spots better than conventional treatments
A: ""Toothpaste contains certain ingredients -- baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, menthol, essential oils, triclosan -- that cause pimples to dry out,""  However, ""there are no ingredients in toothpaste that make this method more effective than conventional treatments.. 

Q: What does toothpaste do to acne
A: Toothpaste irritates the skin, so some may believe that it dries out pimples, but what it really does is irritate and cause redness and peeling. 

Q: Can toothpaste be used to treat pimples?
A: An internet search turns up many quick-fixes for pimples. Here’s Dr. Khetarpal’s take on some of the most common ones.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: This claim is refuted. According to the QA pair, tubal ligation is a choice made by the woman deciding on getting the treatment. The only requirements to receive this treatment is counselling as it is an irreversible form of contraception. ""When appropiate"" the patients partner can be counselled too. You do not need to have 2 children, married and 25 to get tubal ligation. Therefore, this claim is refuted. 

Evidence:

Q: What is the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommendations to physicians about tubal ligation?
A: The Committee on Practice Bulletins-Gynecology of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has released a practice bulletin on sterilization. “ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 46: Benefits and Risks of Sterilization” appears in the September 2003 issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

According to ACOG, tubal sterilization may be recommended as a safe and effective method for women who desire permanent contraception. Women should be counseled that tubal ligation is not intended to be reversible; therefore, those who do not want permanent contraception should be counseled to consider other methods of contraception.

To reduce future regret, the patient and her partner, when appropriate, should be counseled..

averitec_2809,Fact Check: Shops buy apples that are coated with wax.,"Claim: Shops buy apples that are coated with wax.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Direct confirmation from a trusted source.

Evidence:

Q: Do apples naturally have a coat of wax?
A: Yes. Pick an apple off a tree, buff it a little and it will shine! That’s because the fruit is coated with a layer of natural wax that protects it from drying out and helps to prevent fungi from getting a foothold.

Q: What is an apple's natural wax made of?
A: The wax is a mixture of up to fifty different compounds, most of which fall into the chemical category known as esters. There are also alcohols like heptacosanol and malol as well as hydrocarbons such as triacontane, C30H62. This compound can also be isolated from petroleum and is sometimes applied to fruit to supplement its natural wax. In that case chemophobes kick and scream about a petroleum derivative being applied to their fruit but there is no difference between triacontane produced by an apple isolated from petroleum.. 

Q: Do shop bought apples still have their natural wax?
A: No. After apples are picked they are washed before they appear in the supermarket to remove dirt and chemical residues. This process also removes the wax. Since the waxy layer prevents moisture in the apple from escaping, its loss shortens the storage time for the fruit.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The evidence finds that the honeycomb pattern in honey can differ depending on the species of tree it came from. It is even very hard to tell the difference between fake and real honey. Honey also has no genetic memory and is made up of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other compounds. Hence, this claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: Why does a honeycomb-like pattern sometimes appear when you mix honey in water?
A: University of the Sunshine Coast's Dr Peter Brooks, a chemist with extensive knowledge of the chemical composition of honey, said he would not trust results to come out of DIY tests found on the internet. ""We see a lot of honeys coming through our lab … they can be anything from thin, depending on the species of tree it comes from, or it can be very thick,"" Dr Brooks said. ""I imagine honeys we test in our labs, half of them would pass these tests and half would fail, almost randomly. ""And if you get a good fake honey, one that simulates honey fairly well, you can't tell the difference by the tests they're proposing between a good fake honey and a normal honey. ""Good fake honeys are made to mimic a real honey, and they're very hard to tell the difference between them sometimes. I don't think you can tell the difference on these simple tests."". 

Q: Does honey have a genetic memory?
A: No. Honey is made up of carbohydrates, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other compounds. It contains no genetic material, therefore does not have 'genetic memory'.

The money goes to YOU! All you need to do is report the issue to Central Bank (cpd@cbn.gov.ng) and they will surely take it up.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: The 2nd Q&A pair confirms what the claim says about a fine on banks who fail to return customers funds in a set timeframe of a failed transfere, However it points out that the regulation iteelf does not say who receives the fines, so there is no way of knowing if it does go to the customer as is claimed.

Evidence:

Q: As of the date of the claim, was there a regulation in place stipulating how Nigerian financial institutions should react to failed payments?
A: A circular to all financial institutions in September 2018, directing them to reverse failed payments -- official name being Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) Instant Payment (NIP) -- into customers’ accounts within a day, or pay a  10,000 naira ($28) fine for each item “based on complaints of sender and/ or beneficiary.. 

Q: Does official documentation state  affected customers stand in line to recieve the 10,000 naira fine for a failed online transfer?
A: No. The regulation is completely silent on where each 10,000 naira fine goes.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: Q&A 1 confirms what the claim says about Ted Cruz sending mailers out, However Q&A 2 points out they were not aimed only at elderly people but elderly people did receive them too, so some cherry picking, 
Q&A 4 points out that people did think they were designed to trick people though so also confirming what the claim says about tricking elderly people, but not elderly people only so again some cherry picking.


Evidence:

Q: Was there anything controversial about any campaign letters sent out by Senator Ted Cruz in 2018?
A: Ted Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign has been sending voters in Texas a fund-raising letter in an envelope labeled “summons enclosed,” drawing criticism from some who called it misleading and raising questions about whether such a practice was legal.

Confusion arises not just from the letter itself but from the envelope it arrives in.

The fund-raising appeal comes in an envelope with the words “SUMMONS ENCLOSED — OPEN IMMEDIATELY” written across it in large capital letters. In the upper left-hand corner are three lines of text: “Official Travis County Summons, Voter Enrollment Campaign Division, Ted Cruz for Senate 2018.”. 

Q: Were the 2018 campaign letters sent out by Ted Cruz in envelopes labelled “summons enclosed”, directly targeting elderly Texans?
A: No. However the concern that elderly voters could be tricked was raised when a photo of one of the letters was posted to Twitter on Sunday by Sean Owen, a data scientist who said it arrived at his home in Austin, Tex., and was addressed to his grandmother, who lived there until she died in April.

“My grandmother was facing cognitive decline at the end of her life and I think if she’d read this she might have been deceived by it,” he said in a phone interview. “It feels shady.”

Q: Were the 2018 campaign letters sent out by Ted Cruz in envelopes labelled “summons enclosed”, illegal?
A: No. The practice is legal according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.

Aside from that, he said in an email, “the F.E.C.’s regulations don’t speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.”

The letter inside the envelope is more clearly part of a fund-raising effort. The Cruz campaign logo appears at the top of the letter and recipients are given the option to donate a preselected amount of money or to write in their own denominations.

The letter echoes its envelope, though, in its use of language — like “campaign summons” and “conservative affirmation” — that sounds more legal than colloquial.

averitec_2813,Fact Check: Consuming a wax-coated apple can kill you.,"Claim: Consuming a wax-coated apple can kill you.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A establish what waxes are on apples and that they are safe for consumption.
It might have been useful to ask if the wax is an allergen.

Evidence:

Q: What is the wax covering apples?
A: It’s not artificial, but a natural wax that we call “Abura-agari” in Japanese.. 

Q: Why are apples covered in wax?
A: Fruits like plums, apples, pears etc. have natural wax covering for the retainment of moisture and firmness, and slow down of the natural degradation.

But it is not possible for the farmers and the storekeepers to keep the fruits fresh and juicy for several months at a stretch. Additional food grade wax is being used for increasing the fruit’s shelf-life.. 

Q: Is the wax on Apples toxic?
A: No. It is not toxic. Apples grow with a natural wax. Pick an apple straight from the tree and it does not have that shiny supermarket lustre. However, rub a freshly picked apple with a cloth or on your thigh like a spin bowler and it will quickly shine up. Apples bound for the greengrocer and supermarket are generally washed, polished and coated in a food-grade glazing agent. Fifteen per cent of Australian apples are coated in carnauba wax made from the leaves of a tropical palm straight from the tree. Most of the other 85 per cent are coated in shellac which is made from the lac beetle. It is not made from the beetle itself but a secretion produced by the female lac beetle to protect her eggs. Another little thing vegans need to look out for. You'll find similar glazing agents on shiny confectionary. For people who are very sensitive to bitterness the wax can be perceived as a little bit bitter..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Fake news/ No record of this claim being made officially.

Evidence:

Q: Is there any evidence that Jeong made this statement?
A: No. There is no evidence Jeong made the statement, and the misattributed quote appears to come from a series of fake quotes that emerged on social media after she joined The New York Times in August 2018 as an editorial board staff writer. There is, however, no record of Jeong making the statement. A search of her verified Twitter account, as well as her Facebook page, didn’t turn up any matches. An archived version of her Twitter timeline from early August 2018 shows no such tweet on July 31 of that year, and Check Your Fact also didn’t find any credible media outlets attributing the quote to her. (RELATED: Did The NYT Publish An Op-Ed Comparing Kim Yo Jong To Elizabeth Warren?)

Q: Where did this claim first appear?
A: The quote about a “castration lottery” for white people was first shared on the online message board 4chan in August 2018, around the same time a number of other fake quotes misattributed to Jeong were shared on the website, according to Snopes. One user in that 4chan thread posted a fabricated tweet that Jeong supposedly sent July 31, 2018.. 

Q: What type of website is 4Chan
A: To the uninitiated, 4chan can best be described as a bulging cyst on the ass of the internet.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Evidence indicates regulations do not allow cancerous tumours to enter the food chain - carcasses potentially containing cancer would be put on hold if found during an inspection and then condemned and disposed if cancer was confirmed.

Evidence:

Q: Do animals we eat, get cancer?
A: Yes. Yes but cancer is largely a disease of the aging process, and animals raised for food are slaughtered while they're young

Q: Is meat with cancer dangerous?
A: No. If, by some chance, a meat product does contain cancerous cells, cooking it will kill them. And even if your steak tartare came from a cancer-afflicted cow, there's no evidence to suggest you'd suffer any ill effects.

Q: Are butchers allowed to sell meat with cancers?
A: No. Inspectors that observe potential signs of disease or things such as cancerous lesions or tumors retain the carcasses until the public health veterinarian (PHV) inspector assigned to the establishment can make final disposition of the carcass. The PHV inspector will often send samples to a laboratory for further analysis/confirmation. A carcass remains on hold as suspect until the results of pathology return from a USDA laboratory.

Cancerous lesions or tumors are not allowed to enter commerce or the food chain. If laboratory results indicate the presence of cancer within the carcass, the carcass will be marked U.S. Inspected and condemned. Once a carcass is condemned, it is denatured and disposed of so it cannot enter the food chain.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The QA pairs confirm that when in direct contact it does kill the bacteria however only appears to work topically and not through ingesting for some bugs etc.

Evidence:

Q: Can Manuka honey kill every known bacteria?
A: To date, in vitro assays have found manuka honey can effectively inhibit all problematic bacterial pathogens tested. 

Q: what conclusions have been found about Manuka honey?
A: Great progress has been made recently in our understanding of therapeutic honey, yet its use in clinical medicine remains limited, even when conventional antibiotics are starting to fail. The complexity in honey, which is arguably its greatest strength in killing diverse pathogens and preventing resistance, complicates its study as many factors working together are likely to affect activity. We advocate further mechanistic studies using appropriately registered therapeutic manuka honey, in particular studies that use non-reductionist systems biology approaches, along with detailed chemical and microbiological analyses to elucidate how honey acts at the molecular, cellular and population level, how this can differ in different strains and species of microbial pathogens, and how the host cell responds. 

Q: It seems that Manuka honey is very effective on topical wounds, but is it good at killing bacteria internally?
A: Manuka may inhibit the bacteria that cause a sore (“strep”) throat or gingivitis, but the main components responsible for the antimicrobial activity won’t survive the digestion process..

averitec_2881,Fact Check: Garlic can kill brain cancer cells,"Claim: Garlic can kill brain cancer cells

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: This was a laboratory study, and no conclusions about the effects of garlic on human health can be drawn from it.

This study did not look at the effects of eating garlic in people who have glioblastoma; it also did not look at whether eating garlic prevents people developing cancer. In addition, this study did not look at the effects of these garlic compounds on healthy human cells; therefore it is possible that these compounds also kill healthy cells.

Based on this studies findings, we shouldn’t believe that eating garlic will prevent or cure cancer.

Evidence:

Q: Have any studies been conducted on the effect of garlic on cancer cells?
A: Yes. Dr. Rohini Karandikar, a science education researcher at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE). She explained that although many studies have been conducted regarding the effect of garlic on cancer cells, there has been no major breakthrough yet.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: One study is not enough. The controls were not necessarily scientific enough. 

Evidence:

Q: What happened in the experiment?
A: Some students in Denmark did a school experiment and found cress growing near wi-fi routers went brown.
Apparently the researchers (some 15-year-old schoolchildren, in a classroom experiment in Denmark), decided to run the experiment after noticing they had trouble concentrating the morning after sleeping close to their mobile phones.. 

Q: What did experts think of the experiment?
A: The suggestion by scientists interviewed about the research is that routers give out heat, and this probably dried out the cress in the rooms with the routers in, so equivalent water was not enough for them.

There have been suggestions that the light from mobile phones or tablets just before bed can disrupt sleep patterns, although again there’s not really any strong evidence for this.. 

Q: Did a biology experiment by ninth grade students reveal a ""dark truth"" about the dangers of Wi-Fi?
A: No, that is not clear: The study was conducted as a classroom experiment without the proper scientific controls of a professional lab experiment. The girls take 400 seeds and separated them out across 12 different trays. Six of the trays were placed in each of 2 rooms which were both kept at the same temperature.After 12 days,The cress seeds in the first room were growing well,the seeds that were placed next to the router showed no real growth at all. The scientist observed that The problem is that due to a difference in temperature of just a few degrees, it can already take a couple of days for the cress to grow to the same height.If there was indeed a difference in temperature due to the placement of the laptops, it would be likely that the WiFi group could have germinated and grown similar to the control group if it was allowed to grow on for a couple of days.Norwegian science journalist said We have published around 60 years of research in at least 1,300 peer-reviewed studies that are essentially unable to find any effect on EM radiation cells in the frequency range in question. Nothing. The World Health Organization (WHO) went through 25,000 articles on the topic published over the last 30 years without finding any evidence that such radiation can have a biological effect..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The first Q&A pair state this claim is false, with a statement saying also that birth certificates cannot be used as any sort of currency in the same way a federal bank note can be.

Evidence:

Q: Are U.S. birth certificates federal bank notes valued between $650,000 and $750,000?
A: No. Several internet blogs and videos make false claims that a United States birth certificate is a negotiable instrument (a document that promises payment) that can be used to:

Make purchases that will be charged to a “Exemption Account” (perhaps identified by your social security number or EIN), or
Request savings bonds held by the government in your name and owed to you.
The truth is, birth certificates cannot be used for purchases, nor can they be used to request savings bonds purportedly held by the government.  Also, the “Exemption Account” is a false term; these accounts are fictitious and do not exist in the Treasury system. 

There is no monetary value to a birth certificate or a social security number/EIN, and TreasuryDirect accounts must be funded by the owner (through payroll deductions or from purchasing directly from the owner's personal bank account) to have any value.

Justification: The !st and 2nd Q&A pair coroberate the part of the claim stating that the named man did commit the crime claimed but not the part about the fine which The 4th Q&A pair does state that the man in the claim was receiving state benefits but no Q&A pair state if they were used to pay the fine in the claim. And even Q&A pair 3 only states that someone 'offered' to pay the fine for him.

Q: On Remembrance Day 2011, did a man named Emdadur Choudhury burn poppies?
A: Yes. He was found guilty of burning poppies at a protest in west London on Armistice Day.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: This is true, according to the answers, parking charge notices are issued by private companies who run car parks. 

Evidence:

Q: Who issues Penalty charge notices in the UK?
A: A PCN is a penalty for contravention of parking regulations. It can be paid, contested by appeal, or contested by defending a claim for payment under the small claims track of the county court.
You won’t get a criminal record or points on your licence.
Everything from how PCNs are served, through appeal or payment, to debt recovery is laid down in regulations. PCNs are used for some moving traffic offences too, particularly in London – bus lanes, no entry, restricted turn, yellow box junction.
You may get a PCN by post, by hand or applied to your car windscreen.
You’ve got 28 days to pay or challenge.
A PCN can be up to £70 outside London, and up to £130 in London.
The penalty is usually halved if paid within 14 days.
An unpaid PCN penalty is treated as a civil debt and you could be pursued through the county court system or even get a visit from the bailiff if the debt remains unpaid. Some local authorities don’t have civil parking enforcement powers and in these areas parking is enforced by the police or police-employed traffic wardens who will issue a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) enforced through the criminal justice system.. 

Q: Who issues Parking charge notices in the UK?
A: A parking ticket for private land is called a Parking Charge Notice (PCN) – check your ticket for this wording.

You might get a parking ticket on private land from the owner or a company employed to manage the car park if you:

park without the owner’s permission, or
breach any parking conditions imposed by the owner. 
There may have been signs displaying the rules for using the car park. When you park on private land (like a private car park) you enter into a contract with the landowner. Any signs that clearly display rules for using the car park give you the terms of the contract. The car park owner can take steps to enforce any of these rules if broken.. 

Q: what is a penalty charge notice

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: the second answer shows Casein isn't listed as a known carcinogen and evidence suggests that milk may protect against cancer. 

Evidence:

Q: What is casein?
A: A mixture of related phosphoproteins occurring in milk and cheese. The group is characterized as one of the most nutritive milk proteins, containing all of the common amino acids and rich in the essential ones.. 

Q: Is casein a known carcinogen?
A: It is not listed as a caronigen by IARC or NTP. 

Q: What does the Continuous Update Project say about milk studies?
A: Dairy and cancer
Observed inverse associations between intake of dairy products and colorectal cancer development have been largely attributed to their high calcium content. In addition to calcium, lactic acid-producing bacteria may also protect against colorectal cancer,

while the casein and lactose in milk may increase calcium bioavailability. Other nutrients or bioactive constituents in dairy products, such as lactoferrin, vitamin D (from fortified dairy products) or the short-chain fatty acid butyrate may also impart some protective functions against colorectal cancer, but these require much better elucidation.

The CUP Panel concluded that the evidence was generally consistent for dairy products, milk, cheese and dietary calcium, and showed a decreased risk of colorectal cancer with higher consumption..

Evidence:

Q: Who designed the first Nike Air Jordans ?
A: Peter Moore was the man behind the Air Jordan 1 (and also helped design the Air Jordan II). When Michael Jordan first looked at the AJ I, his response was “I’m not wearing that shoe. I’ll look like a clown”. With time, the shoe slowly grew on him. The original Air Jordan 1 retailed at $65.00.. 

Q: What year did Late musician Prince died ?
A: In the weeks since the 57-year-old singer was found dead at his suburban Minneapolis compound, on 21 April, investigators have been looking into whether he had a prescription drug problem.

This surprised friends and family members, who said Prince avoided alcohol and drugs and maintained a healthy lifestyle.

On Thursday, however, medical examiner A Quinn Strobl released the office’s assessment of Prince’s cause of death: “self-administered fentanyl”, a powerful opioid. The office said it could not offer further comment.

In a press release, the Carver County sheriff’s office said it “continues its investigation”.

Earlier on Thursday Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Prince died of a painkiller overdose.

The official autopsy and toxicology reports have yet to be released.

Prince was last seen alive around 8pm on 20 April, when he was dropped off by an acquaintance at Paisley Park, his sprawling compound in Chanhassen, Minnesota, his longtime hometown. Two staff members appeared at the residence early on the following day, and discovered his body in an elevator on the first floor..

Evidence:

Q: Trump's Grandfather Was A Pimp And Tax Evader Or That His father A Member Of The KKK?
A: Most families of enormous wealth have a dark and sometimes scandalous, even monstrous past. Donald Trump's clan is no exception to that rule. His grandfather was a pimp and a tax evader, his father a racist who would in the course of his life, clash with New York City Police as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and then as a wealthy real estate magnate, refuse to rent to people of color.

Donald Trump's legacy is anything but a rag to riches story. His dad kicked the bucket with $250-$300 million in the bank. The man who wants to ban all people of a particular religion from travel wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth, his was white gold.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The answer shows that the origin of the music is from the UK so the claim is refuted.

Evidence:

Q: What is the origin of the last post
A: The Last Post is one of a number of bugle calls in military tradition which mark the phases of the day. Where ‘Reveille' signaled the start of a soldier's day, the ‘Last Post' signaled its end.
It is believed originally to have been part of a more elaborate routine, known in the British Army as ‘tattoo', that had its origins in the 17th century. During the evening, a duty officer had to do the rounds of his unit's position, checking that the sentry posts were manned, rounding up the off-duty soldiers and packing them off to their beds or billets. He would be accompanied by one or more musicians. The ‘first post' was sounded when the duty officer started his rounds and, as the party proceeded from post to post, a drum was played. The drum beats told off-duty soldiers it was time to rest. If the soldiers were staying in a town, the beats told them it was time to quit the pubs..

averitec_2941,Fact Check: Garlic has proven 100 times more effective than antibiotics.,"Claim: Garlic has proven 100 times more effective than antibiotics.

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The WSU study supports the ""100 times more effective"" claim in relation to one bacterium but the claim is broader than that.

Evidence:

Q: What is the report on garlic being proven to be 100 times more effective than antibiotics?
A: WSU researchers recently reported that diallyl sulfide, a compound found in garlic, is 100 times more effective than the antibiotics erythromycin and ciprofloxacin in killing the toxic bacteria Campylobacter jejuni.. 

Q: How does the garlic compound diallyl sulfide kill bacteria?
A: The garlic compound diallyl sulfide is able to dissolve the biofilm and kill the cowering bacteria underneath 'Campylobacter jejuni' which is hard to kill because it produces a slimy protective biofilm that helps it repels antibiotics and stick to surfaces. 

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of food poisoning in the United States. Food poisoning strikes over 2.4 million Americans each year and symptoms include stomach pains, cramping, diarrhea and fever.

Diallyl sulfide combines with a sulfur containing enzyme in the bacteria.  This changes the enzyme’s function and shuts down cell metabolism; killing bacteria better and faster than antibiotics!. 

Q: Have there been other studies investigating whether garlic has antiviral properties?
A: Yes. One, being ""Garlic for the Common Cold"", whose objectives are to determine whether garlic (Allium sativum) is effective for the prevention or treatment of the common cold when compared to placebo, no treatment, or other treatments.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A pairs state that blood does pass HIV to others, but that eating food contaminated with HIV infected blood should not pass on infection. 

Evidence:

Q: Did a 10 year old Barbados boy contract aids by eating a pineapple that had the vendors blood on?
A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: How is Aids Transmitted?
A: The following are the means by which the HIV virus is spread:

Vertical transmission. HIV can be spread to babies born to, or breastfed by, mothers infected with the virus.

Sexual contact. In adults and adolescents, HIV is spread most commonly by sexual contact with an infected partner. The virus enters the body through the lining of the vagina, vulva, penis, rectum, or abraded or irritated tissues in the lining of the mouth through sexual activity.

Blood contamination. HIV may also be spread through contact with infected blood. However, due to the screening of donated blood for evidence of HIV infection, the risk of acquiring HIV from blood transfusions is extremely low.

Needles. HIV is frequently spread by sharing needles, syringes, or drug use equipment with someone who is infected with the virus. Transmission from patient to health care worker, or vice-versa, through accidental sticks with contaminated needles or other medical instruments, is rare.

No known cases of HIV/AIDS have been spread by the following:

Saliva

Sweat

Tears

Casual contact, such as sharing food utensils, towels, and bedding

Swimming pools

Telephones

Toilet seats

Biting insects (such as mosquitoes). 

Q: Can you catch Aids by eating something with an infected persons blood on it?
A: No. As per the report on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one cannot get HIV from consuming food handled by someone with HIV. Even if the food contained small amounts of HIV-infected blood or semen, exposure to the air, heat from cooking, and stomach acid would destroy the virus. Though it is very rare, HIV can be spread by eating food that has been pre-chewed by someone with HIV. The contamination occurs when infected blood from a caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing. The only known cases are among infants.

A: Other factors that increase the risk of vaginal yeast infections include stress, washing your genitals with soap, wearing synthetic and tight clothes, sweating and using “non-breathable” panty liners or sanitary pads.. 

Q: Can wearing sanitary pads for too long lead to cancer
A: It is true that synthetic materials of the types used in some high-absorbency feminine sanitary products can trap heat and dampness, which may promote the growth of yeast and bacteria and (in rare cases) create the potential for toxic shock syndrome, but that issue is associated with the use of tampons rather than sanitary pads.

Justification: t seems the homelessness did indeed decrease, therefore the label is supported

Evidence:

Q: What was this claim based on?
A: The City of New York's Mayors Management Report 2013.. 

Q: What did The City of New York's Mayors Management Report 2013 conclude about homelessness?
A: The Homeless Outreach Population Estimate (HOPE), a yearly
census conducted by the Department of Homeless Services and its
partners, found 3,180 homeless people on the street the night the
census was conducted in January 2013, a four percent reduction
compared to Fiscal 2012. Since Fiscal 2009, the population
estimates have been up and down but relatively constant on
average. In the long-term the estimate of those living on the street in
2013 is 28 percent lower than the baseline established in 2005. By

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The number 112 does not provide a direct link to state trooper info. Also the number 112 may reroute to the 911 emergency services but it may not.

Q: Is 112 an emergency number in the U.S?
A: No. U.S only uses “911” as its emergency contact number

Q: If dialling 112 in the U.S will a caller be transferred to the emergency services?
A: 1-1-2 is an international number.

So, 1-1-2 is indeed an emergency number- but for Europe, not America. so dialing 1-1-2 in the U.S. will get you to 9-1-1.. 

Q: What number should you call in the U.S if you feel unsafe being pulled over by an unmarked police car?

averitec_2947,Fact Check: Eating black garlic reduces the chances of developing cancer.,"Claim: Eating black garlic reduces the chances of developing cancer.

Verdict: Not Enough Evidence

Justification: Although black garlic may have more enhanced properties to white garlic and also contain properties to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of cancer, there is not enough proved evidence to support the use of black garlic for health purposes on humans.

Evidence:

Q: What are the claimed health benefits of black garlic?
A: The health benefits of black garlic are almost the same as white garlic BUT the fermentation process is said to enhance even further the amazing properties of the “regular” one. In a way it can be considered a kind of super-garlic. Or, in mathematical terms, as a to square white garlic.
The compound S-allylcysteine, a natural component of fresh garlic and a derivative of the amino acid cysteine, is found in much greater concentrations in black garlic. This compound is thought to help lower cholesterol and decrease the risk of cancer.
White garlic is praised throughout the world for its anti-microbial, antibiotic and anti-fungal. All properties that are attributed to allicin. Black garlic’s S-allycysteine improves the absorption of allicin, boosting protection against infections.. 

Q: Have these health benefits been verified?
A: the majority of research on black garlic’s health benefits has been conducted on laboratory animals, so there is still a lack of scientific evidence to support the use of black garlic for health purposes on humans..

Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline.""

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: research shows that 5G doesn't pose adverse health effects on public

Evidence:

Q: What are the health risks of 5G on the human body?
A: To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.

Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body.

As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.. 

Q: Does 5G reduce immunity and cause COVID-19?
A: No. Claims state 5G weakens the immune system, making it easier to contract COVID-19, or that it directly causes the virus. Simply put, research emphasizes that the belief that 5G causes or can spread COVID-19 isn’t true.

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: There is no evidence that Joe BIden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin

Evidence:

Q: Was Victor Shokin investigating Burisma?
A: No. In 2015, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine took the unprecedented step of telling the country it should fire prosecutors who were blocking an investigation of the owner of Burisma, where Hunter Biden was reportedly earning $50,000 a month.

Q: Was Hunter Biden part of Burisma Board?
A: Yes. That Joe Biden's son Hunter was a member of the board of Burisma was only a decoration of no significance.

Q: Why was Victor Shukin fired?
A: In the eyes of many Ukrainians, his biggest failure was that nobody from the former regime was prosecuted for the killing of protesters here on Independence Square.
Parliamentarian Yehor Soboliev was the first official to demand the prosecutor's dismissal.

Another reason was failure to investigate grand corruption of Yanukovych. Ukrainian prosecutor general's office didn't want to help to provide evidence..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: The first Q&A states that at most says if you are around the people in the claim that you should be vaccinated, the claim says the opposite of this.
Q&A 2 specifically says that all people should get vaccinated if they are around immunocompromised people. which is the opposite to what is claimed.


Evidence:

Q: Does the Public Health England guidelines list staying away from those with compromised immune systems, babies, children, pregnant women, and the elderly if you have been recently vaccinated?
A: No. Public Health England does, however, say ""vaccination of close contacts of vulnerable people has a major benefit by reducing the risk of exposure to wild-type infection.""

Q: What does the Public Health England advise on those close to immunocompromised people?
A: Public Health England advise that to minimise the risk of infection in immunosuppressed individuals for whom live vaccines are contraindicated, their close contacts should be fully immunised according to the UK schedule, as a matter of priority. Close contacts of severely immunosuppressed individuals should also be offered vaccination against varicella and influenza. This will reduce the risk of exposure of vulnerable individuals to the serious consequences of vaccine-preventable infections.. 

Q: What are Public Health England guidelines for babies, young children, the elderly and pregnant women?
A: PHE provides no guidelines or warnings on interacting with people who have recently received live vaccinations. It also says that having a pregnant household member does not mean someone shouldn’t get the routine vaccinations..

Q: Did Instagram merge #BlackOutTuesday and #BlackLivesMatter posts?
A: No answer could be found.. 

Q: Does posting for Blackouttuesday make other protests on Instagram for BLM harder to see?
A: No. “If you edit your post to remove a hashtag, your post will no longer be shown on that hashtag page,” she said. “In some cases, it may take up to 10 minutes for the post to be removed once you edit it. If someone uses #blacklivesmatter and #blackouttuesday in their caption, the post will appear on both hashtag pages – we are not merging the pages.”

Verdict: Conflicting Evidence/Cherrypicking

Justification: The UK already controlled immigration prior to Brexit because it was not a member of the Schengen passport-free zone (part of the Schengen agreement requires the 26 signatories to agree not to conduct border checks among themselves), whereas the UK would check passports.

averitec_3057,Fact Check: Using the air conditioning (AC) in a vehicle consumes more fuel.,"Claim: Using the air conditioning (AC) in a vehicle consumes more fuel.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: Using the AC does consume more fuel, but also it is more fuel efficient than opening windows at high speeds. but this is still confirmed

Evidence:

Q: How can the use of air conditioning (AC) in a vehicle reduce fuel consumption?
A: Running your car's air conditioning is the main contributor to reduced fuel economy in hot weather. Its effect depends on a number of factors, such as the outside temperature, humidity, and intensity of the sun. Under very hot conditions, AC use can reduce a conventional vehicle's fuel economy by more than 25%, particularly on short trips.1,2,3 The AC's effect on hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs) can be even larger on a percentage basis.2. 

Q: How does vehicle air conditioning (AC) work?
A: ... the air conditioning system uses the following parts:

Compressor — compresses the refrigerant into a fluid, so the liquid refrigerant flows through a line to the condenser.
Condenser — removes the heat from the refrigerant and pushes it along to the expansion valve or orifice tube.
Expansion valve or orifice tube — returns the refrigerant to its original gaseous state and moves it to the receiver/drier or accumulator.
Receiver/drier or accumulator — removes moisture from the refrigerant and transfers it to the evaporator.
Evaporator — pulls heat from the air passing through its core and transfers it into the refrigerant, resulting in cold air flowing beyond the evaporator.. 

Q: Can using a vehicle's air conditioning (AC) be fuel-efficient?
A: Yes. According to the EPA, using your car’s AC can be more efficient while driving at highway speeds than having the windows open. Open windows elevate aerodynamic drag, causing the engine to work harder and burn more fuel.

Q&A 4 agrees with claim as it shows the covid virus is more contagious, as well as needing other medications to fight it over the common cold so claim of covid being more virulent is correct.

Evidence:

Q: Is Coronavirus the same as a common cold?
A: Coronaviruses form a large family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses. They include the common cold as well as more serious diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and, more recently, COVID-19.. 

Q: What is the Wuhan Coronavirus?
A: Covid-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the strain of coronavirus that first emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This strain of coronavirus hadn’t been seen in humans before.. 

Q: What is the common cold?
A: Colds are caused by many different viruses, but most commonly a rhinovirus or a coronavirus. A cold only affects your upper respiratory tract (your nose and throat), not your lungs. Because of this a cold is often referred to as a ""head cold"". Colds usually aren't serious..

Verdict: Refuted

Justification: Q&A 2 points out that 5g radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don’t damage cells in the way x-rays, gamma rays and uv does, so unlikely to damage a body's immune system as claimed.
Q&A 1 shows there is no evidence to support the claim either.
With Q&a 2 saying Public Health England has said that there’s no “convincing evidence” that exposure below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.

Evidence:

Q: Is there any evidence that 5g is harmful to humans?
A: there is no evidence that 5G is harmful to humans. 5G is the next generation of wireless network technology, following on from 4G. Like 4G, 3G and 2G before it, 5G mobile data is transmitted over radio waves—a small part of the whole electromagnetic spectrum (which includes microwaves, visible light and X-rays).. 

Q: Are the radio waves transmitted by 5g damaging to the body?
A: These radio waves are non-ionising, meaning they don’t damage the DNA inside cells, as X-rays, gamma rays and UV rays are able to do. 5G, although at slightly higher frequencies than previous networks, is still in this radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Public Health England has said that there’s no “convincing evidence” that exposure below International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation guidelines can cause adverse health effects. These guidelines go up to 300GHz, whereas the maximum for 5G will probably only be in the tens of GHz.

Verdict: Supported

Justification: According to source provided it is medically proven that drinking water before bed has alot of Health benefits 

Evidence:

Q: is there any data that drinking water before bed is better than drinking it at any other time?
A: No. Dr. Marc Gilinov, a cardiovascular surgeon at the Cleveland Clinic, a hospital in the US state of Ohio, examined the claim that drinking water a specific times of the day has particular health benefits. He wrote in this debunk, “There is no data to suggest that ‘when’ you drink matters.” He advised choosing water over soda, and cautioned, “Don’t schedule your drinking according to a fictitious claim that the time you drink it matters.”

Q: Is there evidence that drinking a high water intake will reduce the risk of heart attacks?
A: Yes. This large study of Californians published in 2002 found that high daily water intake (5 or more glasses) resulted in lower risk for fatal coronary heart disease than for people who had low daily water intake (2 or fewer glasses). The study did not record what time of day people were drinking the water.
